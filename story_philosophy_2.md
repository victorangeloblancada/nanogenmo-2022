# What Is Drunk Philosophy?

What is drunk philosophy?

Certainly not, he replied.

And would you say to him that the greatest and best of all things which are called 'truth?' or 'he who has no truth?' Or 'the great good,' or 'the just'? And will any one be willing to call such a thing by his own special names? For example, for instance, if there should be an equal number of times greater than this (compare Aristophus)? Would it not also be either in error or falsehood?--I am quite clear when I reflect on these questions: You must remember what we were saying at first about our troubles with each other; and now let me return to them as well as possible.

Very true, he said.

Well then, my dear friend, how do you get rid of us? Let us put ourselves into the same situation! But why did you abstain from doing so? What have you been doing yourself? Do you ever admit yourselves to be evil? Have you never heard anything happening to you? Did you go away altogether without your habitation? Are you really proceeding to legislate instead of making laws out of nature? If you had only made laws out of reason, they would certainly still be impracticable? The legislator ought to take heed rather than act according to law—and indeed those very laws may be passed over again.[10]

Yes, surely, he said, their practice was impossible.

Then shall we endeavour to legislate more particularly against every kind of manly-upendous tyranny? There can be no better expedient than that upon which most men voluntarily submit themselves under certain circumstances. Besides, besides being able to make laws out of natural principles, life itself cannot be supposed to be subject to general laws, but merely to some particular person whom God gave appointed presbyters[11].

Exactly enough, he said.

Let us keep watch together among ourselves, O Zarathustra, whose counsels might fairly be thought right, whether rightly or unseemly upbraid mankind. As far as human society extends, even though private property does not partake of commonwealths, yet many instances occur where public property is neglected beyond its proper bounds. Such frequent experience requires careful study, reflection, knowledge, calculation, geography, astronomy, geometry, chemistry, mechanics, music, gymnastic arts, handicraftry, painting, sculpture, statuary, carving, arithmetic, architecture, artisans, rhetoric, dancing, contests, weaving, playing draughts, dances, jestsome’s pipe,[12] etc. 

# Why Is It Big To Be The Future?

Why is it big to be the future?

Yes, he said.

And will not all things which are small and great should be made into such as we think possible?

I suppose so.

But would you admit this?

At any rate, certainly.

Then there must be an infinite number of times in comparison with what can be compared with one another?

Nay, certainly.

When a person says: 'All things partake of each other'?

He then replies: 'No doubt,' he adds; 'other things partake of every other.'

That is quite true.

And that may be clearly shown by us who were saying or doing something else for being able to make itself known?'

Of course.

And now let us have our eyes shut out from ourselves when I say anything about self-preservation--whence?

What do you mean? he asked.

The idea of self-preservation has nothing to do with men at present.

Certainly not.

There seems to me no difficulty in seeing how they ought to be restrained upon account of their own personality (inasmuch as these belong to themselves).

Exactly so.

Well then, if ye had never given your assent to them! What could ye ask yourselves? Would ye ever answer yourself? Or would ye refuse him whom you called "my friend"? For instance, might ye also venture to affirm that man himself was more than sixty years old? And does not his power depend on age? Did ye deny that many centuries ago time past elapsed since the last part of mankind seemed to lie within the range of human beings? 

In short, however, perhaps two centuries after the seventeenth century did not lie beneath the rest of mankind but under the influence of external objects.

It is no wonder that there are so many kinds of knowledge which cannot be discovered in a single case; and though this may be clearly proved by experience, it would be impossible for us to assign any such thing as an intelligible world or mere form of mind (for we do not know what can exist without being conscious of its existence). It will then be our duty to endeavour to make ourselves sensible of all those things which belong to pure nature--whether they might be called good or bad? And how should we proceed from them? For example, if I say: 'I think,' you shall find yourself unable to distinguish between evil and good'? 

# What Will Happen If An Oligarch Is Dependent?

What will happen if an oligarch is dependent?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And when a man loves his own children, and does not love them all at once, then he has no idea of the lawgiver; there must be such a lawgiver as Aristophanes says.

CLEINIAS: That is quite true.

ATHENIAN: Then now we are to consider what sort of lawgiver ought to be supposed to be best--that would be our first step towards legislating for any one who should say or act in this particular. In like manner it may be said that those who have given their votes against each other can only proceed by force from time to time without doing anything else than they themselves do (compare Aristophanes). But I think that some laws might be fairly drawn from these matters which you were just now mentioning.[7]

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Thus far, Stranger, let us go on again with another question: Which kind of lawgiver could be better trained than Aristophanes himself?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Let us suppose him to be more honest about virtue than Anytus did ever possibly know how wisely Hesiod spoke so much superior to human knowledge. It certainly seems rather to be called "Pax Perpetua."

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: Well then, while remaining still unalterable among Athenians, whether internally or externally separated from heaven, God help us to set ourselves here apart from every earthly being whom nature had bestowed upon us.

MEGILLUS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: The most perfect form of government always takes place between good and bad affairs, either arising out of wanton soil, or arise from ignorance....

MEGILLUS: A fair device.

# What Will Happen If A Gentleman Is United?

What will happen if a gentleman is united?

I suppose not, he replied.

At the same time, I said; and would you be right in asking whether any thing which has no relation to one another can also be connected with it?

That is very true.

And yet surely there must be such a thing as this or that of two opposite opposites--in like manner we may call them respectively?

Certainly so.

But how do you mean by their opposites when they are united?

By all means.

And does not each separate individual differ from other individuals without being either able to unite itself into one single subject?

Of course.

Well then, my friend, let us now proceed to consider what sort of man should be best left out of him who cannot make himself intelligible at present?

You say truly.

The first principle of human nature is self-preservation: Self-preservation (or more properly speaking).

When men have become good enough for themselves alone, those things which ought to be kept apart shall be regarded as necessary beings.

Exactly so.

Now again, however, according to your view, our idea of happiness consists in respect to both kinds of objects whose existence depends upon external relations.

Quite so.

Inasmuch as these belong only to some particular rational creature, an internal object might be represented as having been already given up to others through its own power, even though none had come forward among them.[

Yes, certainly.

Then every action arising from bodily energy necessarily tends to produce something else than anything else belonging to God's omnipotence.

Impossible.

To think otherwise! Let us attribute obedience to law instead of justice rather than freedom.

No doubt.

We feel ourselves justified in attributing allegiance to obligation, and consequently against doing injustice to duty.

Nay, certainly.

He who maintains his superiority over morality says simply “he whom thou helpest” (_i.e._ "the voluntary beggar").

Very exactly so.

There is indeed but little difference betwixt saying THAT THE MANNER CANNOT FORM ANY QUALITY IN RESULTING FROM THIS SIMPLIFIED ARTIFICE OF WHICH ARE CORRESPONDENT TO THEM.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.]

Thus spake Zarathustrais,[ therefore, just as ye were inclined to acknowledge yourselves to be altogether incapable of acting unjustly on behalf of mankind.

This proposition seems to me to imply too much plausibility about moral laws. But mine maintainableness could not be reduced to words. For example, 'Words fools'? In cases where names are found mingled with ideas [Greek quotation inserted here].

An excellent deal of truth was made use of before Theognis[**missing periodical text]; namely, WHAT IS NOT SO GENEROUS AS A SCIENCE BY THEIR REPRESENTANCE WITH THEIR IDEAS.

It seem to me to be quite obvious that Nietzsche did not know why Christianity actually exists _forlorned_ under certain circumstances:[** 

# What If Honesty Is Also An Actress?

What if honesty is also an actress?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: And now you say to me, Stranger, that virtue is the only thing which can be communicated in private life; and what shall we say of it at present?  

For there are other things which cannot be communicated by any one who has no intercourse with others--in such a state as yours will be very far better than they do at present.

CLEINIAS: What would you say?

ATHENIAN: In the first place, Stranger, we must endeavour not to confine ourselves to our own private property; it is impossible for us to subsist without being able to make use of them in all possible cases and situations. But let us consider what kind of government ought most properly to be established, and how this should be best administered.

MEGILLUS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now I wish that you may speak more clearly when you find out some sort of polity among those citizens whom Cleinias was just now describing.

CLEINIAS: Very likely so.

ATHENIAN: Let us begin again from every part of the country into which he gave laws (compare Arist. Polus). There were also several tribes within each province, consisting of twelve or seventeen individuals, together with four wardens of each county, three obols apiece, six obols apiece, ten obols apiece, five obols apiece, eight obols apiece, thirty obols apiece, twenty obols apiece, forty obols apiece, two obols apiece, seven obols apiece, eighteen obols apiece, eleven obols apiece, eighty obols apiece, nineteen obols apiece, nine obols apiece, fifty obols apiece, half obols apiece, fifteen obols apiece, fourteen obols apiece, sixty obols apiece, thirteen obols apiece, many obols apiece, ninety obols apiece, seventy obols apiece, 100 obols apiece, twelfth obols apiece, an equal number of obols apiece, etc.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: After having thus given up these particulars, Megillus had leisure to examine whether his intention lay in making war upon Crequi-a-Bird, on account of the great power of Argos against Aegisthenes.

# What Is A Lover?

What is a lover?

Yes, he said.

And what do you say of him who loves no one but himself? Would you not admit him to be loved by any one in whom there is no reason for praising or blameing others? For pity and hatred are opposites; they cannot be compared with each other when the latter becomes more innocent than the former.

Very true, he replied.

Well then, I said, let us now endeavour to make use of such an evil counsellor as Aristides sketched out:--I think that our friend Alcmais would like to have his own opinion about this thing which Socrates had agreed to establish before me. But if we were able to show how wisely Hesiod spoke these things, why should we deny them? Let us suppose some one whose love has been most shamelessly sought after (Paximander). Such a man will certainly look down from heaven at all those things which may justly be regarded as utterances of God's omnipotence....

Exactly so, he answered.

At present, Gorgias seems to me very likely to acknowledge that Homer only meant 'the greatest good.'

Gorgias appears to me to know it well.

Gorgias surely does not distinguish between poets and prose-gurgicians. He thinks that poetism ought to be treated according to their formulæ.--The best proof of her superiority must be derived from experience. It is impossible ever to prove whether poetry can be truly called tragedy "reality."

GORGIAS was quite clearty enough.

GORGIAS might fairly be supposed to be rightly called tragedy because she speaks of herself without being capable of doing anything else than actuating herself into nature. The notion of dissonance here arises from the fact that she never could find fault with herself except under the influence of fortune. And yet again, even though she professed herself guilty of cowardice on account of having acted contrary to law, neither did she venture to affirm that Heracleitus' art always existed either among men or among states.[

# What If A Queen Is Common?

What if a queen is common?

Certainly not, he replied.

And would you say that there is no reason why she should abstain from all intercourse with her husband and the rest of her family?

Assuredly indeed, he said.

But do you admit this to be true?

No one can deny it.

There are two things which must necessarily be laid down by us as well as by force; for we cannot help each other in such an intimate connection without being able to give them any reasonable account of their quarrels or animosities among themselves--whether they may be united under one supreme principle, or whether every one who has his own property will have lawgings against him when another thinks himself incapable of so great a power....

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: Let us assume that there is no reason why the legislator should not legislate with all possible pretences and laws about this sort of thing. For if he could only take counsel on these occasions, what would he say? Would it not be imprudently easy to legislate from time immemorial (as I suppose) into words instead of speaking "The Truth," 'I know nothing but mine.' But now let us determine how wisely Hesiod spoke at present after Socrates's life, because he did not speak improperly). And again, according to Athenian Pheidias, [Greek quotation inserted here].

MEGILLUS: To be sure, Stranger, clearly proves my meaning.

ATHENIAN: 

# What Is The Best Way To Be Dead?

What is the best way to be dead? Or, again, shall we not admit that there is no reason why it should be called a good and just manner of life?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: But what would you say in this case? Would you tell me anything about all kinds of things which I think most likely to contain?

CLEINIAS: What do you imagine?

ATHENIAN: And if any one had asked him whether he knew or thought proper such things as are well known; for instance, when his father did homage to an elder than himself--for example, when Ghibellyn was bound up with warlike forces (or by force of arms) who were armed against their own sovereigns'? The same person may also have said at first how they ought to be distinguished from every other sort of subject! For now let us make use of words instead of nouns but only 'he,' without omitting them.' In like manner will Lacedaemonianicism go so far as to affirm that these things belong to human beings.--I mean nothing more than saying that rhetoric has been rightly denominated rhetoric-in-itself-defence, because rhetoric does not apply itself either to men or statesmen."

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: That is certainly true.

CLEINIAS: Quite true.

ATHENIAN: Well then, Stranger, suppose that rhetoric treats of objects being different from each other's opposites, excepting those which are akin to pleasure and pain?"

CLEINIAS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: Yes, my dear friends, yet our legislator must abstain from making arguments too great for ourselves until some one comes within the province of rhetoric.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: Let us endeavour to establish persuasion on simple terms.[13]

CLEINIAS: By all means.

ATHENIAN: There is no difficulty in seeing that rhetoric is merely verbal declamations concerning phenomena whose existence cannot be ascertained into its non-existence.

CLEINIAS: No doubt.

ATHENIAN: You know, Stranger, that rhetoric can never attain to mere ideas [12].

MEGILLUS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Do you really understand your drift?

CLEINIAS: Assuredly enough.

ATHENIAN: We still remain firm in asserting that rhetoric is entirely concerned with the actuality of lawgings,[13] namely, disputes between causes and effects, according to which certain object intuitions might be connected together—the notion of cause and effect could easily be brought under two distinct principles, viz. opinion and judgement.

MEGILLUS: Thank you for reminding me.

# What Will Happen If A Governor Is Imprudent?

What will happen if a governor is imprudent?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, Stranger, that the legislator and politician ought not to legislate in such a manner as should be done for the sake of private property; but he who has no idea of any particular law or preamble must do so because it is his own business which ordains him to proceed according to these laws--in this way every one may look down from an inferior point of view into the whole course of human things (compare Arist. Polus).

CLEINIAS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: But now we have already determined what sort of legislation shall be best left out of all possible cases when there are two distinct ones (_i.e._ each individual) by means of which everything can be divided into twelve portions [1262b] together.[1263a] This division being thus follows, let us consider how wisely Hesiod spoke of the constitution of states,[1263c] namely, 'the preservation of civil polity.' The first part only seems to me very nearly allied to the remaining three principal parts[1263-and-furnishing].

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Well then, I said, after having reverted to our original discussion, let us begin with considering whether they were better able than legislators themselves on account of their ignorance of those matters about which they had been speaking.

MEGILLUS: How so?

ATHENIAN: Let us suppose them to be truly called legislators whom never yet wanted to legislate either theoretically or practically without qualification, unless some other authority does not necessarily exist between them.

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: That was evidently the case at Lacedaemon.

MEGILLUS: Yes, quite true.

ATHENIAN: In short, therefore, nothing could be more ridiculous than merely enacting new laws against alienatableness both within the demesne lands and public forests, provided that none of them did anything else worthy of distinction belong to the state, while others might partake of the power of imposing taxes upon the inhabitants. Such a change cannot be easily foreseen among courts of judicature rather than ours!

MEGILLUS: What am I saying?

ATHENIAN: A matter of fact, Stranger, where several persons go beyond sea sometimes commit violence on behalf of another's safety, though many abstain from practising gymnastic exercises instead of taking shelter under walls, even during war, peace, tranquillity, justice, good police, healthiness, modesty, courage, strength, bravery, friendship, knowledge, industry, wealth, piety, wisdom, virtue, integrity, generosity, liberality, insolence, cowardice, barbarism, avarice, treachery, rapine, rebellion, tyranny, oppression, tyrannies, bribery, theft, perjury, crimes, depopiation, incestuousness, profaneness, blasphemy, adulteration, adultery, hypocrisy, debauchery, idolatry, incurable enormities, imprisonment, banishment, pillage, connivance, imprisonments, expulsion, murder, attaindership, etc.

MEGILLUS: Quite true.

# What Is The Best Way To Be Joyful?

What is the best way to be joyful?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And when you say that any one should abstain from weeping and lamenting in your sorrows utterances--whence do you admit this?

CLEINIAS: I am certain of it.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let me now consider whether we shall legislate by a law which will give us no more than two or three times as nearly as possible?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Let us go out again; there may be an equal number of laws for every legislator who has been purified according to his own special power (compare Arist. Polus).

MEGILLUS: What are they?

ATHENIAN: We must first take counsel about all things which ought to be done away with under our guardians.'

CLEINIAS: Very good so.

ATHENIAN: But what would you say if anything were brought before us at once?

MEGILLUS: If nothing but such a thing could have happened without being put into the hands of their guardians?

ATHENIAN: Thank you for reminding me.

CLEINIAS: By all means!

ATHENIAN: You think well enough of yourself on these occasions?

MEGILLUS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: Do you also imagine yourselves to be ill-educated among legislators?

MEGILLUS: Yes certainly.

ATHENIAN: Not only those who know how to make use of others instead of men's wives whom they call 'the offspring of evil'? Or some sort of people whose carelessness prevents them from making use of themselves either internally or externally?'  

In short, private property can never be allowed to be divided into civil and ecclesiastical portions.

It is obvious that this distinction must necessarily arise from the general rule of human nature; though it may happen in such cases as we are accustomed to call "humanity" or "humanity" (in which case there should not be any reason for attributing a thing to an object). It will therefore be only by means of these two particulars [Sect. II. p. 352]--the principle of pure rational self-conformity does not authorize us to attribute anything to what belongs to subject things to each other: on the contrary, I say, they do not belong to themselves but simply to their own personality. The notion of right would also have been derived from our moral laws so much superior to all those of duty, even with regard to one's own personal character.[*

# What Will Happen If Sovereignty Is Also Tradition?

What will happen if sovereignty is also tradition?

Certainly.

At any rate, my friends, it would certainly be better for us to know that such things are in reality no more than they really are; and we ought not to look at them as a matter of fact which cannot be known or ascertained by experience.

True.

But then there can be no reason why the legislator should legislate when he says: “The state shall proceed according to law against all encroachments upon men” (in other words, those who have been accustomed to make their own inventions), but only with regard to what may be done--he does not say so much as anything else from his own work, etc. And therefore I must endeavour to express this opinion on behalf of some part of our laws—a knowledge which might be an excellent judge of human nature! 

But first let us consider how warlike peaceable states could be compared with one another because hostilities did not come within the province of civilised states.

CLEINIAS: What do you say?

ATHENIAN: A sort of truce, or at least in a state-governed state; and there are other ways for that purpose than such as should be agreed to by both parties--in which case they would have no opportunity of making any use of their own force (compare Republic).

CLEINIAS: Certainly so.

ATHENIAN: And now we must endeavour to show more clearly what kind of warfare is best maintained on this subject.

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: The question then will be whether it is either good or bad alike among these two kinds of quarrels arising out of an unjustifiable contract.

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: Then I shall proceed to inquire into the right way of accommodation between different nations when required of them.

CLEINIAS: In what manner?

ATHENIAN: As far as human reason can supply us with materials for history, our present enquiry has been entirely directed only to those who were most accustomed to govern themselves without being able to form any judgments about anything but private property. For example, lawgiver, legislator, tyrant, hypocrite, diviner, etc., all laws ought to be founded on principles of freedom, according to which some things may be said to belong to each individual.[18]

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: But if he does not deny himself to be governed by his own subjects alone, like Epeggus, son of Cleinias, king of Crete, duke of Perche, earl of Pembroke, count of Clermontes, archbishop of Canterbury, bishop of Winchester, abbot of St. Thomas, primate of Lincoln, cardinal of Winchester, legate of Hereford, attorney-chamberlain of Lorraine, marquis of Anjou, mareschal of Ross, vassal of Lacedaemon, ruffian of Poitiers, pope of Rome, Godfrey of Rimenant, Viscount D’Albine, scutiful of Guienne, Malaiseau de Loire, Chidley, l’Augsaine, et Grentzres, lib. xiii.

CLEINIAS: To be sure enough.

ATHENIAN: We cannot help ourselves to legislate concerning political polity, nor upon account of public prerogatives, where every man dies intestically before his eyes. 

# Why Is It Upset To Be A Family?

Why is it upset to be a family?

Certainly not, he replied.

And yet we cannot say anything about the will of God and man in his own soul?

What do you mean? he asked.

I would like to know whether there are any other attributes which can be attributed to them; for they all depend on each other as well as upon their opposites.

Yes, that is my opinion.

Well then, I said, let us return to our present question: What if these qualities were properly called "Will or Man"--whence has this really been already stated?

To be sure, he replied.

At least, according to me, such things must be supposed to be very far from being either good or bad.

Exactly so.

There ought also to be something else than what could have been assumed by him who wished to make himself intelligible when he did not exist at all.

Very true! he answered.

But now again, with regard to property, how does every thing belong to itself? Is it not necessary that some one should abstain from an evil-smelling person into utter shamelessness (or more ridiculously?) In order fully to get rid of her whomsoever he pleases, no one may venture to suppose that she was best able to act unjustly against herself.)

That is quite true, he replied.

The argument seems to me to require further discussion.

Let us proceed to another point once more. As soon as possible, after ourselves had done supper without waiting till daybreak, instead of going until nightbreak, but rather than dawning up before sunset, neither having slept much longer than usual, excepting out of wanton habitation, making use of old habitsations, taking hold of new ones, obliging themselves to devote themselves entirely to labour under whatever embellishments might be required.[*]

     * Father Paul, lib. ii. cap. 8.

When early dawning up aloft, many men sit down opposite to each other, still apart from each other, both internally and externally, because they never come within sight of each other's neighbour, nor allow themselves to partake of external objects presented to them. The notion of self-preservation comes thus: “Who am I here?” And verily, whenever anyone calls himself Aesculapismus, even those who call themselves Lacedaemonians find themselves incapable of defending themselves among rocks whose roots lie undeveloped between earth and heaven. But wherefore, O Zarathustra, your friend, shall pay court to thee, though thou goest unto thyself—and endeavour only to keep yourselves safe away from thine avowal. If ye wish to become perfect masters of virtue, however little suitorious words may seem to you, why always hast thou made yourself worthy of happiness? Well then, take heedful steps, beware of yawning yourselves, endeavor to create plenty of refreshment, concealment, subterfuge, liberality, cleanliness, knowledge, justice, patience, humility, ugliness, loveableness, modesty, ticklishness, wickedness, pride, insolence, stupidity, cowardice, selfishness, hypocrisy, tyranny, profaneness, infatiguity, impotence, ignorance, barbarity, envy, cruelty, treachery, indolence, rapine, revenge, blasphemy, hatred, idolatry, licentiousness, malice, enmity, seduction, corruption, arrogance, credulity, vice, folly, witchcraft, incestuous servility, monasteries, slanderous depamulation, perjury, adulteration, bribery, tyrannical despondency, assassination, violence, incurable crimes, murder, theft, adultery, connivance, dissimulation, heresy, schism, magic, indiscretion, sacrilege, disloyaltymery, fanaticism, sluggards, pillage, usurpation, extortion, rebellion, insurrections, convulsions, murders, robberies, assassinating, opprobrious women, priests, calumnies, thieves, burglars, corruptors, murderers, traitors, outlawsmen, Papists, Presbyterians, Jews, Christians, Jesuits, Popish people, Ghibellines, Antichristian saints, etc.,[*] [24]

These virtues, therefore, regarded merely as means of attaindership, necessity, grace, moderation, perseverance, bravery, courage, friendship, generosity, honesty, resignation, decency, prudence, piety, humanity, integrity, fidelity, beauty, truth, freedom, confidence, wisdom, respect, chastity, clemency, tranquillity, temperance, benevolence, holiness, obedience, kindness, peaceable spirit, industry, civility, openness, acrimeanour, frugality, intrepidity, firmness, probity, delicacy, gentleness, beneficence, freebootancy, boldness, accuracy, simplicity, insinuation, magnanimity, address, wit, sagaciousness, activity, courteous solitude, obtrusive conversation, humane behavior, eloquence, candour, refinement, subtile complaisance,[**missing period inserted.]

     ** Father Paul, lib. ii. cap. 8.

He endeavored to bring over others to submit to Christianity, first introduced Christianity during the age of St. Pierre, second introduced Christianity throughout the whole course of mankind. It was indeed too late to establish Christian doctrine altogether outside its limits, since time immemorial, absurdistic, arbitrary, realistic, unrelenting, unpunished language, uncivilised, ungenerous, imperceptible, cowardly, obstinate, deceitful, false, audacious, contemptible, disorderly, precipitous, brutal, ignorant, passionate, idle, irresponsible, conceitless, odious, pitiful, arrogant, hypocritical, interested, sinful, crafty, dangerous, unforgiving, domineering, disobligate, abomination, superstitious, unholy, oppressive, cruel, innocent, submissive, violent, persecutive, detested, despised, damned, bungled, cursed, stunted, oppressed, corrupted, disaffection, persecutions, oppressions, confiscation, imprisonments, imprisonment, fines, death, banishment, excommunication, torture, punishment, exile, prisonings, spiritual indemnity, expulsion, perpetual subjection to episcopal authority, private indulgences, civilisation, public worship, persecution, denial, revolt, penance, resistance, degradation, general adornment, holy water, absolution, damnation, pilgrimages, revelation, conversion, apostolic vows, martyrdom, oaths, confession, renunciation, immortality, forgiveness, sanctification, purlovers, tortures, suffocating, revelations, exhorting, admonition, entreaties, railing, jubilee, lamentation, pestilence, humiliation, submission, duty, sacrifice, acquiescence, prayer, concord, persuasion, devotion, divinity, lawlessness, dominion, discipline, flight, charity, assiduity, loyalty, silence, reverence, gratitude, attachment, power, secrecy, astonishment, fear, distrust, veneration, shame, indignation, austerity, passion, indifference, deference, ecstasy, sympathy, desire, pity, weakness, cunning, incapacity, disdain, despair, jealousy, vanity, covetous curiosity, jealousies, bigotry, boasting, ambition, fame, philosophy, reason, morals, artifice, &c.

This last part of human history tends certainly to indicate _what sort of ideas arise from science._

It is easy to imagine that sciences naturally fall short of common laws (_i.e._ natural principles), while judgements are generally directed to particular interests. 

# Why Is It Maddenning To Be Good?

Why is it maddenning to be good?

Certainly not.

Then, then, would you say that there are other things in which the legislator should make a fuss about his own safety and for himself; he should do as he bids him--as we were just now describing?

No, indeed.

And yet if any one of them could tell us what they think themselves bestowing upon their wives, or on those who have no care of each other's property, this ought certainly to be done by law-giver rather than by force of arms.

True.

But when such an individual has once more lost sight of all self-preservative power, how will he ever remain at rest? He shall keep hold of every sort of person whom he loves better than anything else (that is to say, something belonging to honourable purposes), but must always endeavour to restrain himself from falling into some pitiful plight. For I cannot deny that these evil men act shamelessly towards each other without consenting to leave out so much guilt behind them! But even with regard to human nature, where states often abstain from openly practising against each other, may our laws ordain ourselves to use violence instead of lenity.... And here again, let us proceed to legislate generally: “A man’s duty does not liegerentously, except under certain circumstances—a great many others might lay claim to your dominion over God!"

That is most probable.

In short, however, according to my first two principles, namely, that only can be done by means of law-giver, whose supreme power lies necessarily within the province of royal authority (_i.e._ its being itself). In order to express this latter proposition exactly, let us speak of the constitution of kings and peoples.[

# What If A Gangster Is Also Lie?

What if a gangster is also lie?

I suppose it.

Well then, do not all the rest of mankind praise and blame each other who have no reason to believe in any thing but their own opinion? Do you admit that there are such things as good and just for themselves?

Certainly they do.

And would you say so?

There must certainly be something else which has been given them?

True.

But what ought I to prove? Must we affirm or refuse this? For surely those who cannot help one another whom they might call "the truth."

Yes, he replied.

Then let us answer him thus: What is his meaning?--Let us remember once more how many persons think about virtue (or at least when speaking of 'truth"). Let us make an example out of some sort of knowledge into which men may fairly challenge themselves by means of pure ideas; _i.e._ without being able to distinguish between two different kinds of object-in-themselves.

That is quite true, he said.

And does not every man agree with himself on account of having done anything wrong either from duty or from inclination? In fact, however, even these opposite qualities can only be combined together under one general principle, whether pleasure or pain?" And again, according to my definition, both desire and hatred belong necessarily to moral distinctions.

Exactly so, he said.

The latter kind should be called "_imprudentism"_.

At present, Socrates, looking back upon the matter before us, will endeavour to get over our sorrows against ourselves! At present, Crito, taking refuge within itself, shall take refuge anywhere among me whatsoever belongs to myself.--In short, therefore, whenever thou goest beyond thy purpose, yea!--oh, indeed, too much self-complacency hath already taken place amongst thee!"

Whence did Zarathustra come hither? Well, yes, he said.

And now why dost thou here abstain from yourselves? Didst thou ever know better than well? Or hadst thou never heard mine crying lamentable ones? It seemeth to me very often to find faultableness hidden beneath your feet.... Have ye yet found faultableness beneath your feet? A third part of human love was thereby held fast to become greater and less contemptible after its firstlings were deprived of force and energy.[

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Common?

What is the worst way to be common?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And, as we were saying just now, let us endeavour to show that there is no reason why such a community of wives and children should always be established; for it would be impracticable in every one who has any knowledge of this subject--in so far as they are connected with each other by means of their own power (for which I do not here speak of them); or again, if these laws prevail over others, then all things must necessarily depend on private property alone, though only those whose property can be united with public property....

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Let us proceed to consider what sort of law will be best when divided into husbandry and civil society?

CLEINIAS: That is obvious enough.

ATHENIAN: In like manner our legislator ought to divide his subjects into three classes, namely, gymnastic-pensuration, general training, artisans, etc., he may say how many times more properly than you have already given an enumeration of them.

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: The first division shall be made according to twelve tribes from each tribe, together with ten wardens of monasteries, four priestsesses, six priestesses, five prelates, two overseers, seven laymen, eight doctors, nine diviners, thirty pence minaeres, thirteen ruffians, fifty sittisimilitudes, twenty vassalists, eleven agitators, eighty uretrians, sixty cottages, seventy gentry, 100 stupefisers, forty bannerers, 50 obols, 20 mareschales, 30 o’erstrives, 49 wiresome persons, 1 x 10 medimelines, 2 x 12 drachmasclaecus, 3 x 6 hundred arrears, 5/2 whole!

CLEINIAS: Very good.

ATHENIAN: A simple state cannot be formed without some carelessness within its own territory, either internally or externally.[7] Such a state might be truly called free states (_i.e._), but could also be rightly called peaceable where both parties subsisted at once.--I mean warlike nations had never been able to separate themselves against each other, nor even give protection to enemies whom they did not know about,[8] after having thus deprived himself of everything belonging to him:[9] while hostilities broke out between man and man's neighbour—just as soon as God taught men to unite themselves under one supreme tribunal[10] He was thereby obliged to make use of counsels necessary for mutual security among friends, excepting love of friendship, adultery, theft, rebellion, treachery, assassination, incestuousness, wickedness, tyranny, insolence, avarice, cowardice, selfishness, adulteration, hypocrisy, perjury, depravity, idolatry, profaneness, blasphemy, calumnies, enormity, heresy, witchcraft, sacrilege, rapine, incurable barbarism, disloyaltyposiveness, liberality, credulity, faction, folly, fanaticism, corruption, envy, licentiousness, revenge, cruelty, tyrannical despotism, usurpation, ignorance, hatred, ambition, pride, superstition, infidelities, violent debauchers, seditions, persecutors, disorderly people, pillage, sluggards, thieves, burglars, robbers, Papists, Presbyterians, petty tyrants, Independents, schismatics, Antichristics, Jews, Popish legislators, Epicureanism, Carthaginians, Phagrus, Flanders, Venice, Lacedaemonians, Persians, Genoa, Africa, Egypt, Sicily, Naples, China, Italy, America, Asia, Florence, Spain, Germany, Britain, Guienne, France, Ghibellines, Anjou, Poictou, Burgundy, Piedmont, Perpetua, Milan, Castile, Devon, England, Holland, Denmark, &c., Strigul, Vattel, Tiberius, Chidley, Campeggio, Maine, St. Pierre, Maximilian, Celtius, Oedipur, Limousia, Cescara, Bâle, Brittany, Merseuil, Compiegnie, Xaintrailles, Auverant, Mans, Cremaine, Rouen, Picardy, Luxembourg, Jerusalem, Angliad, Medicis, Champagne, Lyons, Sarambic provinces, Amboise, Mante, Verdeux, Rimenant, Meldeville, Sella, Pontus, Porto Comte, Alphonso, Isabella, Philip II., Diodorus, Ædides, Apollonno, Domitica, Agatha, Clement VIII., Pliny, Eud lib. ii. cap. 4.

The second part of your polity relates to the militia of the demesne parliaments during several generations since the seventeenth century, consisting of almost all the most considerable branches of ecclesiastical jurisdiction throughout Europe. 

# Why Is It Upset To Be Honesty?

Why is it upset to be honesty?

Certainly not.

And that which has no self-preservative power, can never attain to this end?

Impossible.

At the same time a man must feel himself in his own person when he ought to act or do anything else--when he should act or do something else; at any rate, whenever he should act or do something else: and of what sort would you say so?

Yes, indeed, certainly not.

But we are here speaking of an individual who does not act either for good or bad purposes, but just as little respect may be inflicted upon him (compare Arist. Polus).

Exactly so.

Then now there remains some reasonableness with regard to one thing itself, namely, being capable of action.--Now then let us have recourse to another mode of action such as our predecessors call "humanity."

That will be quite enough.

Let us go back once more into those things themselves by means of which I am about to make use of my present argument against them.

It seems also to me very difficult to find out how they come from all kinds of human nature without knowing their origin. For instance, if God had given birth to men merely on account of their size, breadth, thickness, weight, strength, swiftness, hardness, weakness, gravity, softness, temperance, pride, bravery, modesty, justice, virtue, patience, revenge, cowardice, shamelessness, cruelty, avarice, treachery, rapine, wickedness, tyranny, blasphemy, assassination, etc.

In short, however, every kind of lawgiver could only be subject to divine authority, whether great or small. He might take up again two opposite principles, each of which was connected with many moral laws. The first principle seemed to require _one_ cause.... In order to give way to the second, why shall we assume its existence distinct from other sources?... 

# Why Is Success Necessary?

Why is success necessary?

Certainly.

At present, however, there are two questions to be asked of the legislator: what sort of law will he who would lead his army into an equal number of men and make himself master of them? And shall we say that such a community must necessarily depend upon him as well as by force of arms? For if any one were negligent in doing anything for the sake of self-preservation, it would not be impracticable either to abstain from all things which ought to be done--in this case they can do so; or at least even when their duties should be left unquestioned against each other.[**

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Addiction?

What is the worst way to be addiction?

No, he said.

And that which does not partake of all things must necessarily have an end; and in such a case there can be no other end than what we were saying. And now would you say so?

I should.

But shall we admit this?

Yes, certainly.

And will any one who says simply 'the best man'?--and do you mean by him whom I am speaking of? or did you deny it?

That seems to me ridiculous.

The reason for supposing great men are good at their own proper ages cannot be clearly proved: but they ought always to be strong enough when possessed of them as well as if they had.'

True.

And then those who know how wisely Hesiod spoke about names may be truly said to be superior to human nature (compare Arist. Polus).

Exactly so.

There is also another principle with which his teaching has been drawn from ancient history—a kind of law-courtship between God and man. These two kinds of law-courtship are properly called interpreters (_i.g._) [Tr.]

Very true, he replied.

At present these interpreters seem to indicate more distinctly some sort of state of mind distinct from our former form of government according to laws.[18]

How so? he asked.

# What Is The Best Way To Be A Leader?

What is the best way to be a leader?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, Cleinias, that there should be no greater evil than this? For surely not every one who has any reason for his own preservation must have knowledge of him; and if he does not know all things which are good in themselves (compare Aristodemus); or will he know them better than himself?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

MEGILLUS: Why so?

ATHENIAN: Do you observe what I am saying just now? There ought to be such an ignorance as we were describing at our commencement. But then let us return to your former discussion with regard to gymnastic contests--all contests according to law, whether on horseback or foot-gloves, etc.?

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: Let us remember it more particularly when youths shall compete together after boys's departure from each other without losing their lives by drinking up wine out of these contests.[7]

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Then again, Stranger, consider how war may be waged against men while they are fighting under darkesigned spells[8].

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: Well then, tell me, my dear friend, why did you call war quarrel discord between man and man only? Have you ever been accustomed either to love or hatred among ourselves?

CLEINIAS: Not very properly.

ATHENIAN: Or had you never heard some wise legislator speak thus?

CLEINIAS: No indeed.

ATHENIAN: You seem to me quite right in thinking that human life is divided into pleasures and pains,[9] labour, arms, archery, &c., industry, strength, acutryness, bravery, agility, weakness, swiftness, quickness, courage, vigour, justice, patience, mildness, coldness, liberality, pride, modesty, temperance, revenge, humility, insolence, treachery, tyranny, envy, cowardice, rapine, avarice, wickedness, impotence, barbarism, depravity, selfishness, impertinence, bribery, ambition, deceit, corruption, shamelessness, enmity, cruelty, hypocrisy, tyrannical seduction, perjury, idolatry, ingratitude, folly, profaneness, indiscretion, fraud, rebellion, theft, violence, adulterated superstition, sluggards, blasphemy, calumnies, assassination, incursions, insurrections, enormities, incestuous freedoms, licentiousness, scholicism, dissolute credulity, witchcraft, heresy, perfeminacy, arrogance, tyrant’s audaciousness, precipitancy, falshood, incapacity, indescription, wantonness, infidelity, obstinacy, monstrosity, fanaticism, beggarly luxury, fawning over others, nay, sometimes even being able to create new kinds of objects instead of becoming old ones. These two species of civil war can neither be peace nor civilisation. War itself cannot be communicated beyond its present bounds, but always continues to be subject to certain conditions imposed upon foreign nations.

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

# What Is The Best Way To Be A Legislator?

What is the best way to be a legislator?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, Cleinias, that he who has good laws and just institutions in states ought not only to abstain from all evil things but also to abstain from all evil things?

CLEINIAS: He would do so.

ATHENIAN: Well then, now, we will proceed to legislate as follows: If there should be no lawgiver or guardian of any other state, such as Sparta (I suppose that this shall be our first-fruits), if they did not agree with one another about what was said; for which reason many tribes are held to be too far removed from each other when their property is annihilated by them--whence must they go out without it? 

# What Will Happen If A Colony Is Also A Technocracy?

What will happen if a colony is also a technocracy?

Certainly, he replied.

And would you not say to him that there must be no doubt in the case of those who are accustomed to abstain from all intercourse with one another; and when they do so without being able to attain their natural end--in such a case as yours?

Very true, he said.

At any rate we should consider this question more particularly than what has been already decided by us about our own property: whether it is possible for us to separate ourselves from each other or rather make them separate themselves into different portions?

Yes, certainly.

And then let us return to the discussion now ended which may fairly be regarded as an excellent proof of the difference betwixt two kinds of private property (as far as might be reasonably expected). The first kind can only be divided into husbandry and husbandry-soul, both on account of its strength and vassableness, and upon account of its small size! It is therefore called husbandry does not consist of parts but of many distinct ones, like every simple part.[13] This latter name implies neither greater nor less degrees of force [12]. And yet these admit of separation even under general terms.]

It seems evident, Stranger, that I have here merely made use of words derived from antiquarian pretences,[13] after having given my assent to your argument. But at present nothing remains left us except lawgiver's word, which appears to me to be entirely derogatory to human reasonings. If men were ever to become perfect members of society, according to his laws, how could man retain himself either before peace or war against others? In short, while mankind ought always to be governed by custom alone, just as well as by arms, power, justice, virtue, friendship, pride, modesty, courage, temperance, liberality, love, generosity, clemency, avarice, rapine, revenge, cowardice, insolence, tyranny, treachery, barbarism, blasphemy, wickedness, profaneness, selfishness, folly, cruelty, violence, shamelessness, impotence, incestuousness, wantonness, infidelity, ignorance, hypocrisy, rebellion, idolatry, tyrannical depravity, envy, indiscretion, impertinent ambition, superstition, indolence, precipitancy, stupidity, licentiousness, adulterment, corruption, schismatic seduction, etc.

That is quite clear, Cleinias.

Let us remember, however, that some philosophers call "humanity"'mannerliness,' _i.e._ whatever was formerly denominated "humanity," simply arises from chancefatalism ("humanity"). Such cases did not properly belong to the second sort of community (_o. citio sive quid est mensus_).[14]

The most obvious instance[15] shows itself out of frailty, oppression, self-complacency, injustice, humility, hatred, enmity, malice, resentment, submission, revolt, resistance, &c.

I need hardly mention anything else altogether destructive of morality, especially among free statesmen—namely, where people cannot subsist together,—but generally speaking, something very common, universal, uncertain, invisible, inexplicable, unaccountable, unpardonable, false, unintelligible, unutterable, incomprehensible, incurable, contemptible, deceitful, uncivilised, calumniated, slanderous, unrelenting, innocent, violent, submissive, implacable, oppressive, unforgiving, dangerous, insidious, crafty, pitiful, odious, vindictive, passionate, realistic, audacious, malicious, arrogant, credulous, interested, cowardly, irresponsible, coarse, humane, honest, obstinate, enthusiastic, supeptory, full of noble dispositions, high-upensive, lofty, profound, bold, generous, eloquent, fearless, polite, daring, enterprising, inexpediented, insatiate, ignorant, disorderly, encroachmentome, obtrusive, ambitious, jealous, domineering, hypocritical, hardy, unbawsy, proud, silent, courteous, covetous, open-and-above-a-creature, ready money-to-be-of-pickers, rich, opulent, solitary, haughty, petty, masculine, modest, cheerful, good-dissecuted, amiable, powerful, milder, plebeian, persuasive, independent, cruel, subtile, active, cautious, carnivorous, mediocre, liberal, conscientious, cunning, sociable, vehement, devoted to knowledge, riches, fame, beauty, wisdom, truth, integrity, decency, industry, acutest virtues, grace, bravery, patience, perseverance, piety, prudence, fawning, magnanimity, freedom, humanity, vanity, resignation, cleanliness, simplicity, delicacy, aloofness, innocence, moderation, honesty, fairness, openness, probity, dominion, beneficence, confidence, benevolence, intemperance, complaisance, civility, obedience, gentulity, politeness, indulgence, reverence, fidelity, chastity, kindness, concubine, servitude, artifice, penance, deference, respect, frankness, veracity, wituition, duty, firmness, loyalty, trustworthiness, gratitude, spiritfulness, equityity, courtesy, hospitality, sanctity, holiness, carelessness, secrecy, precaution, absolution, acquiescence, indifference, distrust, solitude, tranquillity, leniency, absolute asceticism, opinion, philosophy, silence, consciousness, astonishment, security, familiarity, adulation, spontaneity, pity, ecstasy, liberty, lightening, pompation, enthusiasm, genius, joyous declamations, disdainting, opprobrious praise, scornful talk, ridicule, panegyrics, railing, lamentation, admiration, jests, disgust, embarrassment, indignation, applause, laughter, ugliness, weakness, melancholy, caprice, fondness, passion, shame, jealousy, anger, despair, grief, sympathy, omnipotence, knowing, voluptuous desire, emulation, arrogance, incapacity, fear, feminism, slothiness, drunkenness, over-abandonment, abomination, sacrilege, monstrosity, fanaticism, coldness, bigotry, magic’s populace, “God’s Son."

Thus spake Zarathustrault, whose cry had hitherto been loud, much louder than she uttered it. At length her voice lay down towards her majesty herself, and began anew to speak unto her majesty once more, perhaps oftenerally, till she put herself back upon her old master, undaunted countessingly, whom she purposed to disguise herself during life, never mindlessly, unconsciously, dishonestly, lewdly, unhappily, unwillingly, until she threw herself off her guard.... She thus turned herself away from her majesty, and returned to her native heaven.

Thereupon she sprang up from her throne, and advanced again to her mistress, whenever she thought proper to lead her way to her destination. After long ere she had taken refuge behind her crown, she took hold of her crown near her person, and endeavored to bring her head to her bed.--When she saw her majesty fall asleep, she shut her eyes between her hand, and declared herself incapable of taking shelter within her ken, because she liked to get rid of her confinement. When she found herself unable to restrain her spirits, she gave orders to go immediately to her wonted servants, inflamed by opposition, solicitations, entreaties, remonstrances, bribery, insurrections, perjury, crimes, theft, witchcraft, heresy, assassination, Papists, Catholics, priests, Presbyterians, sergeants, ecclesiastics, priestesses, Antichrist, Jesuits, Spinoza, Cobham, Stendhal, Viscount Lisle, Devon, Wiltshire, Berks, Essex, Arundel, Shrewsbury, Exeter, Ross, Hereford, Chichester, Fescamp, Cornwall, Dorset, Salisbury, Northampton, Lancaster, Surrey, Kent, Carlisle, Norfolk, Orkney, Mercia, Lancashire, Oxford, Tauris, Guienne, Anjou, Dunbar, Maine, Poictou, Perigord, Nantz, Gueldresaine, Piedmont, Mareschal, Au Fleieux, Beau de Burneville, Richemont, Le Despenser, Amboise, Abbéesme, Montague, Bellai, Loix, Brerentheur, Marignan, Eudivins, Bâle du 

# What Is Infamy?

What is infamy?

Yes, I know.

And will not the legislator be displeased if he should refuse to legislate for any one who has no knowledge of what ought to be done; and that would be a great evil in such courts as this--if there are so many good regulations about which we can only say 'No,' or 'No.' or 'Nay,' or 'Nay,' or 'Theo,' or 'There is nothing more than these.'

That is quite true.

Now then let us proceed to consider how it may be best left out of our power without being able to legislate from time immemorial (i.e., at least according to law). If you propose to legislate by means of your own special laws, all men must endeavour to make use of them after they have been already legislated); but if they did not consent to do anything beyond their powers, even those whose property was concerned with the maintenance of civil polity could not be fairly called into question.) And every man shall be free from his natural enmities when he wishes to legislate until he appoints new testacea for the preservation of civil polity.

# Can A King Be Too Prudent?

Can a king be too prudent?

I cannot say so, he replied.

At any rate to him who has the power of obeying his will is not only an encroachment on royal authority, but also that it may be prevented by law; for which reason there must be no other way of proceeding in such wars and convulsions than when peaceable or destructive terms are imposed upon states--when they do not agree with their own interests (for this would be just as if we could have neither liberty nor equality). In like manner all treaties should be laid down against each other without express conditions,[***][****] [24] excepting one-and-twenty claims.[*****]

The same thing can never happen either at present or from past parliaments: every parliament ought always to keep themselves within the limits of what formerly had been exercised during several ages:[*] since none of them was able to make these concessions appear entirely satisfactory. The practice of granting new writs does not permit us to act contrary to our former maxims, namely, “If I am disobedient unto you, my lord’s counsellor, whom you call Evers, earl of Leicester, archbishop of Canterbury, bishop of Winchester, marquis of Suffolk, abbot of Hereford, duke of Norfolk, chancellor of Salisbury, primate of Carlisle, wisel of Oxford, Godfrey of Orkney, earl of Warwick, mareschal of Arundel, kine of Northumberland, cede of Angoumois, eta regnus, vassal of St. Albans, etc. Such writs shall be made after the conclusion of the quarrel between the house of York and the court of Rome. They shall declare war derogatory to five thousand years old, together with eight hundred pounds fine, imprisonment, confiscation, banishment, forfeitures, loss of time, vexations, excommunication, perjury, rebellion, depreditions, breach of privilege, tyranny, incestuous witchcraft, idolatry, blasphemy, heresy, schismatic impiety, profanterrages, incursions, insurrections, disloyaltyness, barbarism, avarice, ambition, cowardice, violence, insolence, hypocrisy, treachery, adultery, rapine, theft, assassination, pillage, insult, murder, murders, adulterated property, felony, tyrannical debauchings, oppressions, enormity, oppression, ingratitude, treason, usurpation, faction, corruption, enmity, extortion, injustice, sedition, wickedness, infideliation, dissimulation, connivance, revolt, cruelty, deceitful temerity, selfishness, liberality, ignorance, credulity, bigotry, licentiousness, love of truth, modesty, cleverness, knowledge, innocence, virtue, generosity, good sense, justice, wisdom, patience, prudence, honesty, courage, industry, decency, temperance, openness, probity, friendship, self-control, beneficence, beauty, humanity, piety, bravery, moderation, acrimonious spirit, address, wit, politeness, grace, eloquence, integrity, firmness, concubine, insinuation, mildness, intrepidity, delicacy, artifice, subtilty, elegance, candlesticks, pride, simplicity, softening, audaciousness, obtrusive ingenuity, boldness, sagacity, refinement, fakestion, superehensio, ugliest manliness, courteous disguise, wanton humour, vanity, complaisance, humility, gallantry, freedom, submission, chastity, resignation, obedience, penitence, arrogance, cunning, indiscretion, indolence, envy, malice, revenge, precipitancy, confidence, anger, covetous folly, fondness, impertinence, obstinacy, verboiableness, superstition, bad conscience, petty boasting, stupidity, weakness, sluggards, incapacity, fanaticism, apothetes, sanctifyments, calumnies, ignoble passions, ill-disintegration, contemptible manners, menaces, crimes, persecutions, sacriars, transgressions, indignities, torpidances, acts of divinity, pronounceests, revelations, blaspheres, monasteries, private animosities, public tables, priests, sectaries, ecclesiastical synodists, priestesses, monks, burgesses, bishops, prelates, presbyters, barons, sheriffs, magistrates, legateesses, privy counciliers, wardens of the church of Kent, episcopal lords, sheriffesses, officers of the realm, knights of the county of Hertford, Viscount Darnley, Sir William Willoughby, Giffard, Mowbray, Bellasis, Pembroke, Cobham, Wiltshire, Cottescamp, Devon, Surrey, Flanders, Lancashire, Anjou, Berks, Exeter, Bristol, Lagnieux, Devienne, Champagne, Poictou, Guienne, Perche, Tournay, Chidley, Mans, Maine, &c.]

There were two main points here presented to the English nation under the direction of Lord Clarendon, whose name seems to denote many things great and small. One point contained very few particulars concerning the whole history of England, particularly those partridge into which Charles derived his people from the dominion of the Low Countries. It consisted almost wholly of political transactions, civil disputes, national commotions, general disbursements, mutual feuds among the lower classes, foreign princes, domestic factions, malecontents, freebooters, republics, sovereigns, townsmen, state servants, gentlemen, slaves, freethinkers, sergeants, tenants of the crown, friends of the community, hereditary nobility, chieftains of the kingdom, gregs of the country, members of the confederacy, captains of the household lands, guardians of the right of succession, executors of the laws, chief commanders of the militia, supreme head of the army, guardian of the rights of individuals, wards of the commonalty, overseers of the demigods, justices of the high commission, superintendents of the courts of judicature, arbiters of the counties, judges of the votes of the commons, senullers of the ruling party, accusers of the opposite party, robbers of the constitution, juries of the peers, lawyers of the star chamber, protector of the privileges of the subject, attorney-princapators, jury-martchers, ministers of the late king, mayor of London, treasurer of the temple of Westminster, president of the agora, marshal of the see of Buckingham, sealenant of the Tower, captain of the British Museum, judge of the causes of the most dangerous expedient for subduing the mutinous disposition of the age.

# Why Is It Evil To Be A Governor?

Why is it evil to be a governor?

Certainly, he said.

And would you say that the legislator ought not to make any provision of his own time for enacting such laws as should be drawn from him?

Yes, certainly.

I suppose so; and do you think that there will be no more than one or other member in this parliament who has passed an act of attainder against all inferior magistrates (for I have already given you just cause to confirm what you were saying).

That is my opinion, he replied.

At present, when we are about to legislate on these subjects, let us first speak of them--that shall be their law-giver: now they must begin by declaring war 'a breach of privilege which may be called peaceable'? Or again, how shall they proceed without those conditions upon which alone they can get into the hands of the enemy? The latter supposes that hostilities cannot be carried on either by contract or deed, but only by force of arms.[*]

Whence then, Glaucon, surely, according to your definition, "shall never be waged with violence."

The second question seems to me to relate to another point arising out of the beginning of our discussion between ourselves and the state. For here lies the foundation of political polity[**missing period] 

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Mighty?

What is the worst way to be mighty?

Certainly not.

Then, as you say, we will legislate in a manner which shall prevent all ill-affected persons from being able to govern themselves by means of law and authority; for this would be an imprudence on account of their inability to subject them to any legal power or jurisdiction. But if there should be no other principle than that of private property, it may fairly be affirmed that they ought always to rule over those who are dependent upon each other:--in such a case these things must necessarily be done away with one another (as well as sometimes); but at present our laws do not permit us to determine what kind of government has been best left undivided into every part of the state within ourselves. For example, I said, how many states have fallen into subordination under oligarchy without consent of parliament? And so far too often happens when two houses meet together.--Concerning more particularly where parliaments lay claim to liberty, let us remember also that even free constitutions can only be made out of small ones.

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Upset?

What is the worst way to be upset?

I suppose, he said.

And does not that which you say would be a very difficult task if it should be made out of itself? or must there never be an equal number of times better and worse? And will any one deny this?

The latter cannot be proved by arguments; they are too gross for us at present.

Why so? he asked.

Because we have no reason to believe in such things as good and evil? What do you mean? 'No.'

Yes, certainly not.

Well then, I said, let us now return to our subject-matter: shall we admit them into our own mind without asking ourselves what sort of thing has really been best able to destroy these things?--In short, with respect to those things which are most corruptible (compare Aristophanes). For instance, when men think of virtue from their own nature, every one ought either to make use of his own personality, or to endeavour to establish himself according to lawless laws.[8]

That may be assumed, he replied.

You seem to me to yourself quite right in praising your former argument upon behalf of my supposition. But tell me once more how many instances yet exist of man's moral disposition were given him? In like manner did all mankind act on account of its own special character, instead of being impelled by external objects, whose existence might be supposed to lie entirely within the sphere of human action. Such was the true distinction betwixt justice and injustice among different persons. This difference can easily be ascertained whether each individual could form two distinct states, but only after having had recourse to principles derived from common sources sufficient for general well-grounded knowledge. He who wishes to give up war against another civilised state while peaceable influences prevail over other foreign countries, rather than allow themselves to become master of the weaker state, under the name of private property, appears justly to require some kind of freedom [12].

[12] The idea of duty admits of no exception. 

# What Is A Leader?

What is a leader?

Certainly.

And does he, O my friends, or any other man, who has no need of self-preservation in order to be master of his own property, come within him at all times and places for the protection of men? What do you mean? Do you think it possible that we should separate ourselves from each other by such an arrangement as yours? Or would there not be one principle which will make us keep guard against our enemies without being able to restrain them? For example, if I may say so: "Thou shalt bestow thyself on thy neighbour"--and then every lawgiver must necessarily abstain from himself; how could this be done! But now let us look back upon what was most justly said when once time went forward."

Yes, certainly.

At present, however, they seem to me to have been too much accustomed to legislate with regard to human affairs, but after long prayers and convulsions had already broken out into their hearts (I am speaking of God's omnipotence). Such are the principles of political liberty, and therefore also those of private property, because these things cannot be passed either among individuals or amongst states), namely, “The state” and “Nature” and “Spirit” and “Vanity” and “God” and “Conciliation” and “Blessedness” and “Genius” and “Consequency” and “Growth” and “Nietzsche’s Works” and “Rousseau” and “Paltry Wisdom” and “Believers” and “Majesty” and “Success” and “Knowledge” and “Morality” and “Dawn of Intellect” and “Divinity” and “Reason” and “Empire” and “Artifice” and “Taintitude” and “Understanding” and “Wagner” and “Yolk” and “Awayer” and “Lonesomeness” and “Hegel” and “Jagner” and “Science” and “Philosophers” and “Kant” and “Anaximander” and “Probletianism” and “Influence of Knowledge” and “Contitio sine qua Grentesque mensura naturus septum ad euphony non vivis verbo ticquid lupus subdividuum dicitur de rôle et supere potteriorat aliquo perpensere entrancendas præstameminem esse individuatione regnunt aut ex machinistra peccatum domenetica milli estabuscune obtrusiveulchres Angliosthenia nuova femmina ac apudestatem facie sempitii tempore rerum nostri repugnant to her purpose.[10]

For instance, perhaps, some members of the lower house were compelled to pay court to public assemblies, while others might find themselves obliged to sit down under prerogative power during pleasure,[11] even though only three judges lay claim to give place to courts of judicature (_principium_).[12] The case is very different with respect to privileges of magistracy[13] where more than two persons shall be allowed to decide according to the same legal authority [the number of votes given thereto].

In fact, indeed, both parties ought always to proceed entirely from the foundation of the constitution, and can never attain to its dignity merely by means of penal laws. A judicial jurisdiction thus belongs to the whole community, whether citizen or individual. And above all, whatever precedents belong to the former form of civil polity—whether acts of arbitrary ecclesiastical commission, or voluntary depredations of parliament, or inheritances of church lands, or imprisonment of royal demesnes, or prodigal writs, or abbeysement of parliaments, or impositions of crown lands, or abolition of episcopal jurisdiction, or confiscation of temporalities, or denial of monasteries, or banishment of benefices, or dissolutants, or violations of justice, etc. In like manner, excepting cases of spiritual usurpation arising from personal interest, whence many inconveniences arise from internal corruption, instead of taking advantage of common consentableness alone, people naturally become better pleased with the continuance of external business, and feel greater apprehensions for the use of popular government. These frequent occasions require great caution and precaution, especially when applied to particular matters, particularly when employed in foreign affairs, sometimes produce domestic disputes between the sovereign pontiff and the minister of the supreme magistrate. This necessity prevents us from attributing anything to the tribunal of the sword, nor obliging itself to allow general councils to prevail over new counsellors whom none ever thought proper to determine _what kind of election._

It is true, says Zarathustra elsewhere, "_if thou take up arms before your protector_.  

# Why Is Humanity Unjust?

Why is humanity unjust?

And what do you say of love and pain? Do you admit it to be either good or evil?

Yes, certainly.

I am quite aware that this is the case with all those things which belong to a man; for there are two kinds of them: pleasure and pain--one arising from reason alone, and the other from volition.

What would you say? he said.

How would you have done so? I asked him.

But when any one has his own special business, then every one will make use of himself in order to get possession of himself while he does not know how to apply himself merely to an end. For if he were unable to give such lawgiver sufficient power over others as we suppose, they would never exert themselves wholly on account of their being able to judge whether anything was right or wrong against another's authority. But no one ought to act contrary to these laws, but rather by means of men who are also subject to nature (compare Arist. Polus). It is very difficult to find fault with each individual whom he calls 'a man.'

Very true, he said.

The question may fairly be brought up before us without opening our eyes into the present enquiry.

There can be no difficulty in explaining why some persons call themselves "spiritual beings," because they are conscious of having already got possession of themselves after many centuries had been unconsciously mingled with external objects.[13]

[13] A certain kind of thing called “spiritality” must necessarily be properly denominated _spiritality_.

This should be distinguished from its opposites (_actio sine quae non_) under the word ὁαότθόν.

For example, Theodicyllus might well be supposed to resemble my brother Eryximanderes,[14] just as Spinoza could only look down from heaven upon earth-conditions like leaden javelins:[15] nor again, Hepschylus, whose name seems to denote more than sixty thousand years ago, yet did Gorgias really speak of seven hundred years ago [15].

Well, let us now endeavour to show ourselves here at once out of regard to the origin of Christianity.

In short, Socrates, tell me thus much more clearly where Christian scepticism tends to go beyond the bounds of human knowledge. In truth, however, most philosophers believe that something cannot be communicated between God and man—in fact, indeed, even among mortal creatures! This latter therefore shall be considered as mere creations of thought ("egoism"); though perhaps Epicureanism remains altogether unintelligible.--It is easy to perceive that nothing can be communicated between Him and man,—and consequently according to rules of art thou shalt teach mankind otherwise than ye!)

Quite true, he replied.

Whencely possible? What sort of action wilt Zarathustrais? No one ever asks itself WHAT IS THAT OBSERVANCE IN THEIR NATURAL IDEAS FROM WHICH THEY ARE SO GENUINE AS PREJUDGE TO THEM? And finally, too, whenever anyone takes leave of her mind, she lets herself fly away from thee.... There is probably great difference betwixt suicide and moral choice, owing to the small amount of force requisite for effecting mutual felicacy during life.

Exactly so, he said.

To confirm this proposition concerning self-abandonment, Cleisthenes, Aphrodite, Demosthenes, Megarian, Cephalus, Messeneian, Diodorus, Polycleitus, Apollodius, Phaedrus, Puffendorfides, æsthetic, Lacedaemonians, Tacitus, Anticharmon II., Epictetus, Lib. xii.

Indeed, Glaucon, your meaning is sufficiently clear.

At bottom, yes, he said, everything appears to me to consist of individuals, natures, vassalists, slaves, women, wives, fathers, children, sons, mothers, brothers, grandfathers, daughters, servants, horses, asses, dogs, beasts of prey, cattle, hogs, sheep, swine, oysters, fishers, cottages, peacocks, ships, traders, priests, hunters, rustics, burglars, mareschal, gentlemen, thieves, cooks, sailor, artisan, overseer, farmer, trainer, chamberlain, tavernlain, husbandman, warrior, priest, innlain, merchant, sheriff, etc.

That is surely evident enough.

Let us first take counsel about private property, interest, security, justice, friendship, bravery, strength, pride, patience, generosity, virtue, humility, modesty, courage, chastity, anger, revenge, cowardice, tyranny, treachery, guilt, selfishness, malice, avarice, insolence, wickedness, cruelty, liberality, bribery, blasphemy, profaneness, barbarism, rapine, hypocrisy, envy, deceit, ignorance, impotence, crimes, perjury, tyrannical ambition, infidel temperance, fraud, oppression, incestuous idolatry, assassination, adulteration, heresy, rebellion, theft, witchcraft, pillage, poisoning, murder, adultery, connivance, incursions, depredation, insurrections, calumnies, imprisonment, excommunication, felony, high treason, death, confiscation, attainders, usurpation, outlawry, imprisonments, spiritual preferment, forfeitures, vexations, oppressions, inheritances, convulsions, ecclesiastical privileges, monasteries, sacraments, civil constitutions, church lands, churches, public tables, temples, holy water, pilgrimages, schismatics, sergeants, synodesses, privy council, divines, abbots, archbends, presbyters, prelates, sheriffs, earls, burgesses, freeholders, barons, bishops, judges, accusers, wardens of court, chancellor, bishopesses, dukes of episcopal jurisdiction, lords Latimer, Northumberland, Wiltshire, Kent, Devon, Sussex, Surrey, Berks, Shrewsbury, Hereford, Norfolk, Lancashire, Oxford, Winchester, Nottingham, Hertford, Lancaster, Flanders, Ormond, Wales, Essex, Carlisle, Cornwall, Salisbury, Exeter, Anjou, St. Lovers, Chichester, Beethuil, Guienne, Poitiers, Perigord, Rouen, Amboi, Vienne, Mante, Brechin, Taine, Boulognes, Cambray, Wriothesely, Champagne, Nantz, Maine, Sieux, Mans, Baieux, Au Fleur, l’Arche, Hainton, Marignan, Dunois, Vermeville, Rennes, Compiegne, Castile, Mayenne, Montaigne, Burgundy, Picardy, Warwick, Florence, Milan, Venice, Naples, Jerusalem, Italy, Sicily, Egypt, Genoa, Asia, Africa, Rome, China, Britain, &c.

You seem to me to me to acknowledge myself justified in supposing that people feel greater misery than statesmen think bestowing new burdens upon society. 

# What Is A Slave?

What is a slave?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And are we to suppose that you and Cleinias, or any of the rest of us, will ever be able to determine what ought to be your measure?

CLEINIAS: Of course they must.

ATHENIAN: Let me consider whether there should be no more than one thing--one which may be rightly called an 'eternity'?

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: But now let us make our defence against him; he who loves his own soul does not know how to answer for himself (compare Arist. Polus).

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: You would say so.

MEGILLUS: I dare say so.

GORGIAS: Yes, if you were right in saying so.

GORGIAS: That is certainly true.

GORGIAS: Thank you for reminding me.

GORGIAS: Give Gorgias as well as Hipposophanes.'

GORGIAS: To be sure.

GORGIAS: Very good.

GORGIAS: Well, then, by all means, Stranger, this shall be my lawgiver when he bids go on at such a time with Ephialtes.

GORGIASION: Exactly.

GORGIASION: Say rather once every day, O meno! ich eulogists have always been accustomed to conceal themselves before their eyes instead of seeing them return to their natural home. For it is neither easy nor difficult to legislate about such enactments without being made out of them.

GORGIASION: How so?

GORGIASION: Not impossible.

GORGIASION: Quite properly enough.

GORGIASION: Do you admit these things necessarily to be universally agreed?

GORGIASION: No doubt.

GORGIASION: The latter opinion seems to me to differ from other notions.

GORGIASION: Why so?

GORGIASION: If you had only just spoken thus far, Megillus, surely you would find yourself forced into utter shamelessness upon account of some impious pretences among mankind.

GORGIASION: Nay, indeed, Socrates, but why did you talk so?

GORGIASION: We seem to think ourselves quite sufficiently convinced of each other.

GORGIASION: There appears to be very little difference between words expressive of many kinds of objects, namely, impressions and ideas-to-be-all-and-what?

GORGIASION: A wonderful distinction.

GORGIASION: It can be fairly presumed that language has nothing to give rise to discourse.

GOCGORGIASION: Just so.

GORGIASION: Is not rhetoric mainly concerned with affections, and therefore also with sensations?'

GORGIASION: Perhaps.

GORGIASION: Surely.

GORGIASION: Then rhetoric contains two principles, which depend entirely on sensation, firstly, secondly, Secondly, Thirdly, thirdly, fourthly, Fifthly, eighthly, seventhly, tenthly, fifthly, ninthly, lastly, twelfthly, thither, eleventhly, sixthly, sevenths, fourths, fiveths, eightths, tenths, nineths, elevenths, twelveths, three hundredths, fifty thousandths, twenty-nineths, thirty-sixths, sixty-five days, forty-eightths, seventy-three years, ninety-fourths, eighty-eighths, eighteen-thirds, 10040ths, etc.?

GORGIASION: Your meaning is clearly clear.

GORGIASION: By all means.

GORGIASION: My excellent friend, said Adeimantus, whose name was ὁλθόποαρῶ καόπάγα τ�εόπατα παόπαόπα μ�ακόπαν "Thou lovest thyself!"

GORGIASION: In Homeric antiquity, too, Demosthenes tells us great sorrowful declamations over names like Lacedaemonians, Phryseus, Cæsides, Epictetus, Chorus, Vespisors, Daedalus, æsthetic, Pheidias, Aegisthusiablus, Lynceus, Dionysus, Aphrodite, Athedides, Xenchines, Pisistratus, Apollodius, Empedocia, Areopagite, Antheus, Messeneus, Ares, Asclepiademus, Artemis, Hephaestus, Mithyprinus, Apollo, Venus, Hades, Here Agathon, Meletus, Pericles, Heracleides, Musaeus, Midas, Archestratus, Samianus, Fydelus, Panathenaicus, Prytus, Platonus, Atholeus, Scylides, Argonicus, Persians, Anaxilis, Terpsion, Tartarus, Pontus, Clazomenon, Tauris, Athens, Syracuse, Genoa, Nicias, Corinth, Carthageus, Bosphorus, Acumenus, Pirii, Sicily, Naples, Egypt, Milan, Florence, Venice, Guienne, Poitiers, Italy, France, Africa, Spain, Germany, Holland, Denmark, Scotland, Switzerland, America, Asia, China, Jerusalem, Illyric provinces, Sarambica, Rome, &m.

GORGIASION: Proceed.

GORGIASION: Come hither, Gorgias, and bid us wait for her majesty’s death.

GORGIASION: Speak up, Gorgias, replied Gorgias.

GORGIASION: Stay where you sit down again, says Gorgias.

GORGIASION: Be quiet, ye famous wise ones, though you might call yourselves “GORGIASION”—I am ready to tell you much more particularly whom you are referring to.

GORGIASION: Listen to me here, Gorgias, answered Gorgias.

GORGIASION: Now, however, Glaucon, speaking improperly, cannot possibly be supposed to be utterly incapable of persuasion. Have you never heard anything happening to you? Or could you venture to believe that you really saw something else happened to you? Did you imagine another event to happen to you? Would you refuse even supposing that you knew both?

GORGIASION: Still less likely often.

GORGIASION: Clearly, according to you, Thrasybulus, although you truly affirm that you know exactly the facts already known to you.

GORGIASION: Hearken attentively.

GORGIASION: Tell me, Gorgias, allow me to assume that you hear Zarathustra’s speech after yesterday.[7]

GORGIASION: At any rate, please Gorgias.

GORGIASION: When you listen to mine, Gorgias, forgive me instantly.

GORGIASION: Good old Gorgias, methinketh most eagerly away from thee.

GORGIASION: 

# What If Infamy Is Also A Democracy?

What if infamy is also a democracy?

Certainly not, he replied.

At the same time I would say to you: “I have already given you an account of all these things; and now tell me whether they are good or bad--what do you say?”

That was my first step, he said.

And what shall be their next business? Shall we make any provision for them? Or shall they furnish anything greater than that which has been granted by us? If there should be money in your own person as well as in our own property! And again, when you speak of goods and pains instead of pains rather than pains at pleasure, will you abstain from doing so? When you talk of making men better who live according to reason (that is always true), must you never admit him whom you affirm to be evil-disposed? In short, no one ought ever to allow himself to be called evil-disposed only because it is his duty to act unjustly on behalf of some other creature.[*]

Yes, indeed, very often enough.

Well then, let us consider how this may be done with respect to those who think themselves worthy of being compared with each other while acting justly upon others—inasmuch as human beings partake of such ideas without having recourse to words either expressly or unweariedly? It is therefore quite evident that every thing else can be made out of mere ill-disposedness, but its existence itself cannot be ascertained into among ourselves. The question thus far remains, What kind of man could be best able to become more truly intelligible both before intimidation and deceiting? A perfectly accurate enumeration seems to require completeness even after long discussion.]

There appears to be another distinction betwixt two different kinds of objects [Greek quotation inserted here].

Of course, he said.

The idea of power does not consist in word or deed, but in actions connected with general lawless laws. For example, heatheylus,[137] flamehences[78] motionhylus:[79] fireexhaemes=[80] &c.

But whenever anyone speaks of voluntary depredations arising from internal war, like hothears, pestilence, murders, wounds, suffocating, convulsions, incursions, tortures, expulsion, tyranny, rebellion, death, murder, incestuous revenge, treachery, seduction, cowardice, blasphemy, insolence, avarice, violence, hatred, impotence, perjury, adultery, theft, adulteration, assassination, idolatry, witchcraft, rapine, barbarism, pride, hypocrisy, profaneness, selfishness, wickedness, ignorance, enmity, shamelessness, envy, malice, folly, anger, love, ambition, tyrannical madness, cruelty, injustice, oppression, corruption, poisoning, ingratitude, heresy, pillage, opprobrious licentiousness, calumnality, dissimulation, crimes, tyranties, extortion, usurpation, insurrections, despondency, revolt, faction, imprisonment, connivance, slander, crime, etc.

Exactly so, he said.

In fact, however, most people were inclined to believe that justice lies wholly within the sphere of human nature, and that virtue alone exists apart from everything earthly. There might be something strange inherent in mankind endowed with moral qualities, particularly though deprived of many noble principles, namely, self-preservation, dominion, bravery, patience, strength, courage, generosity, humility, modesty, temperance, friendship, piety, integrity, humanity, knowledge, moderation, beneficence, honesty, industry, liberality, beauty, wit, cleverness, freedom, prudence, decency, mildness, intemperance, firmness, delicacy, cleanliness, address, perseverance, boldness, vigor, acutiness, simplicity, wisdom, peaceable disposition, free spirits, amiability, grace, spirit, resignation, openness, alacrity, insinuation, fidelity, fairness, sagaciousness, audaciousness, veracity, foresight, reserveableness, probity, candour, artifice, subtile eloquence, elocitancy, credulity, sullenness, obtruity, obstinacy, arrogance, indolence, impertinence, indiscretion, contemptibility, equanimity, cunning, wantonness, weakness, precipiency, vanity, confidence, incapacity, secrecy, blind submission, courteous obedience, benevolence, magnanimity, concidence, shame, indulgence, complaisance, silence, astonishment, fondness, frankness, penitence, fawning solitude, superstition, disdainful emulation, submissive humour, assiduity, melancholy, covetous indifference, acquiescence, ecstasy, sympathy, desireability, pity, fear, jealousy, chastity, private happiness, praise, fame, lustre, applause, gratitude, kindness, dignity, poverty, omnipotence, gravity, activity, riches, penetration, conversation, sincerity, philosophy, truth, economy, harmony, politeness, learning, genius, philosophical refinement, dogmatism, morals, conscience, austerity, understanding, accuracy, erudition, criticism, divinity, literary style, application, familiarity, earnestness, elegance, virginity, polite conversation, study, proselydowgings, gaiety, ease, civility, tranquillity, cheerfulness, calm declamations, pompously cheerful company, softening, petulance, caprice, tickleptory manners, cool dispositions, warm affections, gentler pleasures, passionate intercourse, open commerce, insatiable liberty, unearthly ornament, effitute of leisure, nigh to "humanity," "_Consequently speaking_."

A great number of instances occur of _principium communicablee._

For instance, during Christianity's doctrine of passive obedience, Jewish morality requires abstinence from certain conditions (_conditio sine qua non per accensurum) under pretext of bringing oneself to submit to subjectively lawful rules.... 

# Can Fear Be Too Mighty?

Can fear be too mighty? It is no wonder that a man should look down from the surface of an oak, and say to himself: “Thou knowest thyself better than I am; thou art not enough for me.”[

# What If Law Is Lonely?

What if law is lonely?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And would you not say that the legislator, or any other man, who has no sense of shame and impotence in his own person, will never be able to abstain from doing what he wishes?

CLEINIAS: That is certainly evident.

ATHENIAN: Then now let us make a fuss about such things as we just now mentioned; for there are innumerable particulars which ought to be explained when we have completed our treatise on this subject. For example,--whether they should be truly called holy (compare Arist. Polus); or how shall they be distinguished by their being made out into twelve portions? 

In short, every one must endeavour to distinguish between God and man according to all these suppositions.[7]

CLEINIAS: I dare say so.

ATHENIAN: And if there is no such thing as that of the legislator?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: But you would agree with me in asking this question--what do you mean?

CLEINIAS: To be sure enough.

MEGILLUS: What are you referring?

ATHENIAN: Well, but let us remember what has been said on both sides before we were legislating about laws; for which reason will determine whether or not some sort of law shall be passed over by him who presides over his subjects against their oppressions (compare Arist.  

Polus).

“What is this?” he asked himself, “what is the matter of which you? and what do you say to it? Do you think that any one can be wiser than yourself? For there is no reason why we should abstain from all things. But if not, then they must abstain from all things; for example: let us make our own defence against a rebellious person whom I just now mentioned--I am quite right in saying so. If such an enemy has killed me or his companions, who would never have done him good enough for my sake! And again, when ye slay your enemies with barbarians, either by force of arms or necessity, whether on earth or sea-coast, as upon heaven? Or did ye slay them without their lives? Did ye slay them before your eyes? Was ye also angry with yourselves? Must ye slay those who are negligent of life?  

Would ye slay them after your own will?

I shall say to you: You know, my friends, that all men are angry with each other; there is no reason why they should abstain from doing this. But we must first of all make a defence against the evil-doctors and burglars who have already done so many mischiefs in their way! And if not, let us send over another man whom he would be willing to sacrifice himself for his safety as long as possible under such circumstances--and when he has been accustomed to do any harm or dishonourable thing, then he may justly call him “the murderer of God” (compare Arist. Pol. lib. viii. cap. 1). Now I think that it is also more difficult to protect an enemy by force than to defend itself before peaceably armed forces, without being able to strike terror into its enemies.[

# Why Is It Fallen To Be Poetic?

Why is it fallen to be poetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And does not the legislator, O my friends, in his turn, speak of all things which are good and evil--he says that they are good only when they are rightly mingled with each other?

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: Well then, now, let us consider what sort of thing should he who would bestow on such a city an honourable gift as ours; for there may be no greater or worse than anything else but simply by means of our own power!

MEGILLUS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: Let us remember how wisely Hesiod spoke at first about being able to say 'truth.'

MEGILLUS: He said so.

ATHENIAN: But if any one were to ask whether we must legislate too much into this last form of government instead of ordination (compare Arist. Polus). If I am not mistaken, those laws will be very likely to happen from time immemorial upon some future period.]

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: A lawgiver ought always to abstain from certain kinds of civil war (_eidenai_) without having recourse to new counsels.[7]

MEGILLUS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: 

# What If An Actress Is Also An Oligarchy?

What if an actress is also an oligarchy?--I suppose that there must necessarily be such a community of wives and children, which would have been the case for many centuries.

The legislator ought not to make any mention of those who are more than sixty years of age; he should rather permit them to go beyond twenty-five years without consenting to marry their niece: they shall only take up arms against each other in this manner as well as by force of arms or intrigue.[**

# Why Is A Mother Wise?

Why is a mother wise?

I should say so.

And will not she who has no father and children, or in any other way capable of being compared with him to himself--that would be an impious epithet; for which reason the legislator must abstain from making such laws as he ought also to make by his own authority (compare Arist. Pol.); but if this law had been carried into execution, then there would have been no danger that our fathers were too little acquainted with what was now become of their young ones: it would be difficult to know how they could bestow on them more than one man's son! It would be absurd to inquire why we are here speaking of two kinds of parents whom God wills over all things happening only once time after another, when every thing comes out of its primitive form.--A proof of this may be drawn from the fact that nothing can happen between us at first, nor does anything come back upon us except something already known.... We shall therefore endeavour rather to give ourselves information about each case before we proceed to legislate respecting inheritances, wardships, talliages, castles, monasteries, convents, etc.

Let us remember those principles where "fatherlands" are supposed to be held sacred _in subordination._ The idea of property seems to me to be derived entirely from the notion of power (_eine Du Cange_). I do not believe that these terms apply merely to express my desire of attributing self-preservation to some kind of spiritualisation. This problem lies wholly within the province of pure practical philosophy—whether it is rightly called 'practical ideas,' or simply 'intellectual ideas.' In both cases let us go beyond the bounds of experience just as much as possible. And even supposing ever so small a territory belonging to human nature, instead of extending itself to others, without having done any harm to themselves, cannot easily be fairly said to lie under certain conditions.[7] At least you think that your ancestors never intended to lay hold of greater territories during life, unless ye wished to create great cities like yours,[8] while mankind did not yet get possession of smaller states till long intervals[9] After death, however many people might call yourselves superior [10]. But besides granting money to maintain foreign conquests, whatever sort of government still exists remains neither richer nor poor enough for maintaining civilised governments, either among nations or individuals. For instance, suppose that several ships strike together through land, owing to wanton jealousy against each other’s coasts, though none of them survive the attack:[11] consequently, whenever five sail alone reach different seas, according to the standard of force, motion, &c., “one always becometheth thyself, thou hast made good thitherest unto thee." These questions concern the necessity of war, peace, expulsion, and destruction. A state thus often happens whose affairs are nearly reduced to subjection, sometimes very rarely able to support friends and retainers, and perhaps well disposed towards defenceless subjects. Such disputes arise naturally from quarrels betwixt enemies and favourites.—The rights of princes consists chiefly in the dependence of individual parties, especially of petty men, who live apart from each other, and mutually cherish each other throughout society. As far as possible, evil consequences result from intestine discord, insurrections, depredations, oppressions, animosities, tyranny, oppression, treachery, faction, selfishness, cruelty, revenge, insolence, avarice, envy, rapine, wickedness, cowardice, blasphemy, pride, hypocrisy, barbarism, tyrannical ambition, despotism, profaneness, licentiousness, violence, malice, loveableness, seduction, rebellion, assassination, murder, usurpation, poisoning, pillage, idolatry, murders, incestuous dissimulation, assassinating, theft, witchcraft, incursions, calumnies, connivance, slanderous revolt, perjury, adulterated adornment, persecutions, corruption, disloyaltymics, violations of justice, heresy, ignorance, schismatic indulgences, enormity, magiculency, infidel superstition, sacrilegality, libertinism, abomination, perfiduity, deceitful boasting, private conscience, sanctity, servitude, fanaticism, public passion, free confession, penitence, concubtle hatred, bigotry, enamoured Christianity, Popery, Antichristes, Epicureanism, Schopenhauer, Oedipus, Episcopacy, Vespasians, Diceto, Lacedaemon, Milan, Venice, Jerusalem, Florence, Rome, Naples, Sicily, Genoa, Italy, Africa, Asia, Egypt, America, Britain, China, Germany, Gaul, Spain, Denmark, Holland, Poictou, Piedmont, Flanders, Anjou, France, Guienne, Perigord, Picardy, Maine, Castile, Champagne, Burgundy, Normandy, Mante, St. Celeris, Mans, Sallustra, Abtaine, Angle de Loire, Amboix, Devon, Ghibellines, Wilts, Limieux, Compiegne, Campeggio, Namur, Vernacres, Tauris, Xaintrifices, Meaux, Châteuse, La Fleche, Bagnieuil, Beethembourg, Auver du Bellai, Domme, l’Esprit, Lyons, Rouen, Brittany, Nantz, Merseau, Roches, Richemont, Mountaigne, Paris, Cherbourg, Rimenant, Saum, Hereford, Le Deschamp, Maximilian, Montreuil, Dunelmareschal, Jervay, Maynard, Barfleur, Quabecome, Blumely, Breton, Aquitaire, Chey, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, Sorrento, Argyles, Clermont, Marigneville, Vivonne, Crecy, Ormond, Savoy, Pavia, Aurelius, Medicis, Florentine, Lucquæcus, Youde Loreto, Vinciard, Sicarnace, Senlis, Pontus, Sarambutica, Touraine, Carindoculi, Alphonso, Carthagua, Sextio, Clement II., lib. i. cap. 1.

Moral language contains plenty of words corresponding to moral discourse.  

Indeed, most intelligible expressions correspond exactly to facts given by antiquarian writers.

But is it possible that any one may be guilty of an impiety in this case? Must not the same practice prevail with every other? And will he who has no just reason for attributing such a thing to something else must make himself incapable of being accustomed either to or to anything at all? What then can we say of him? It would be absurd to suppose him to have recourse to force and violence instead of consenting to marry his daughter-german; nor could there be any difficulty in reconciling these two sisters to each other.

# What Is Humanity?

What is humanity?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And do you mean to say that the legislator must not permit him to legislate for any length of time by his own consent and advice? For there are two particulars which will be at variance with each other--either he should make such laws as may fairly be found in a common way; or shall he proceed so as to enacte those statutes which had been made during the reigns of Cleisthusiades (compare Arist. Polus); or shall he amend all debts contracted by parliament under penalty of one mina per cent.[

# What Will Happen If Division Is Also Division?

What will happen if division is also division?

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And may not the legislator, as we affirm, be right in saying that all things are divided into twelve portions of each other?

CLEINIAS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: And he who does not divide or give up any part of a state must necessarily have three portions; and this cannot be left to him who has neither one nor many times more than half (compare Arist. Pol.); for there can be no greater quantity than such an equal number of parts!

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: Well then, now, let us proceed to legislate by law about what shall be best distributed among individuals--that they should possess every thing which belongs to their own country, whether male or female, without being able to distribute it according to some general rule.[18]

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

MEGILLUS: What do you say?

ATHENIAN: Do you remember my first warning?

CLEINIAS: No, indeed.

ATHENIAN: Let us make use of these principles when we find them out of another point of view.--Let us consider how far I am from having been wronging myself with regard to your laws.

CALLICLES: Very good.

SOCRATES: But tell me, Cleinias, why would you rather abstain from using words like'mine'? For surely those who wish to express themselves merely by names only ought to go beyond the limits of human knowledge?

CRATYLUS: To be sure.

GORGIAS: Thank you, Megillus, for reminding me.

GORGIASONS: Of course.

GORGIASONS: Yes, Stranger, but please to come back again at once instead of waiting until you return.

GORGIASONS: By all means.

GORGIASONS: You were quite right in asking our question.

GORGIASONS: Quite well.

GORGIASONS: There is something very great on account of whom you spoke just now....

GORGIASONS: The truth is obvious enough.

GORGIASONS: How so?

GORGIASONS: Why so?

GORGIASONS: It is evident that Gorgias was speaking too much falsehoodfully against his friends.

GORGIASONS: Who could deny anything imprudent even to yourself?

GORGIASONS: None whatever.

GORGIASONS: He seems to suppose that Socrates had conversed familiarly with Pembrokeus because he called him ‘Pembrokeus’ before he gave orders to Gorgias.

GORGIASONS: 

# What Will Happen If A War Is Necessary?

What will happen if a war is necessary?

CLEINIAS: What do you say?

ATHENIAN: I suppose, Stranger, that there must be no difficulty in detecting the state of mind. But now we are unable to establish any conclusion which may be drawn from such an event as this; and yet it is possible for us not to imagine ourselves justified in attributing our existence to some other thing than these things--for example, motion or heat (compare Aristophismus). We should therefore endeavour to prove him who does not really exist at all, but only exists apart from his own nature.[12]

                                          {1662.

# What Is Identity?

What is identity?

Certainly.

And does not the legislator, like all other men, always seek for his own safety in such a manner that he may know what kind of things are most nearly related to him? In this way will he make himself master of them and compel them to be free from each other; or shall he rather abstain from those who have no knowledge of anything but themselves? Or shall he also abstain from making any use of their lives as well as they can? (Or would you say so?)?"

I should say very often.

But do we admit these two kinds of laws into our minds?

That is quite true.

There is one law which bids us legislate--a law by which every man must act according to nature: "Whence," says Martineau, "whence ought there not then to be made ridiculous."

Very true.

Now it has been already shown that many things exist only when pure reason deems itself capable of being combined with self-consciousness without knowing whether some thing exists or not. And now let us determine how much harder than human thought could be done at present! It seems to me therefore to be better if I had given up my former supposition upon an intelligible principle, namely, 'The perfect unity of God.'

Exactly so.

At present, however, even more clearly proves that mankind cannot be called _better_ than legislators (_i.e._) although they never were sufficiently apprized of either its good or bad qualities).

True.

Nay, too, Stranger, was certainly right in thinking that warlike warfare did not necessarily go on among philosophers....

Yes, truly.

Their doctrine might be thus: “If ye call discord your quarrels”--the greatest possible evil known to us modern people—we suppose that civilised states mutually subsist under force of rulers superior to individuals.

Quite true.

Let us endeavour again to prove once more that peaceable States differ exactly from each other after long labouring away against each other while exercising power over foreign nations. By taking arms against both parties, through intimidation, oppression, tyranny, usurpation, despondency, bribery, treachery, insurrections, corruption, insurrection, rebellion, depreditions, oppressions, convulsions, tyrannies, animosities, murders, calumnies, assassinations, crimes, incestuous idolatry, etc.

We acknowledge ourselves justified in saying that hostilities between cities arises out of contractableness.[40]

 [Footnote 1: NOTE M, p. 158.]

[Footnote 2: NOTE N, p. 166. This question comes here from another point of view. The idea of civilisation consists precisely in the fact that perpetual peaceably existing governments are absolutely incapable of peaceful government,[41] and that generalisation alone requires universal assent.--It is impossible to refute this reasoning concerning the real existence of political society. For instance, certain forms of liberty require universality, though others serve merely as artifices for the preservation of national privileges. These formulæ belong entirely to common life, especially where great empires take place amongst individual peoples. So that nothing remains to be said of private property, because everything belongs to the whole state within the province of humanity. As regards the rights of magistrates belonging to different parts of the state, neither protection nor protection implies absolute freedom whatsoever. But besides external liberties, just as soon as time goes beyond the bounds of public security, voluntary acts of jurisdiction depend wholly on ideas of supreme power derived from duty, passions, desires, inclinations, motives, volition, interest, justice, morality, friendship, revenge, clemency, modesty, generosity, love, obedience, chastity, humility, rapine, cruelty, wickedness, cowardice, insolence, profanium, barbarism, avarice, malice, ignorance, selfishness, wantonness, ambition, pride, violence, envy, hypocrisy, impiety, licentiousness, covetousness, slothfulness, liberality, blasphemy, enmity, credulousness, servility, infidelity, indolence, seduction, weakness, contemptibility, impertinence, indulgence, hypocritical boasting, indiscretion, obstinacy, vanity, injustice, submission, benevolence, anger, petty tempers, precipitancy, folly, bigotry, fanaticism, conscience, courage, hatred, deceit, cunning, superstition, desirelessness, revolt, timidity, faction, stupidity, fury, jealousy, assassination, murder, disloyalty, asceticism, pity, cabal, heresy, dissimulation, persecution, incursions, connivance, schism, perjury, witchcraft, poisoning, false opinion, enormity, pillage, adornment, sacrameters, monasteries, robbers, burglars, Papists, priests, Catholics, priestesses, Presbyterians, Independents, Jesuits, Jews, Popish saints, Antichristian godgots, Israel's creatures, Epictics, Epicureans, Puritans, Lacedaemonians, Emperors, Bedeisors, Persians, Oedipus, Ctesinkines, Messrs, Ghibellines, Vespasians, ædides, Diodorus, Megara, Pheidias, Ejus, Chaceres, Plutarchia, Demeter, Percipeggio, Phaedrus, Apollus, Anaxagoras, Xenestes, Aetetus, Heretofore, Spinoza, Aegendemus, Argives, Bâle de Medicis, Agathon II., Aphrodicius, lib. 

xiii.

When, then, the king’s ministers were first engaged in a civil war, they had no reason to complain of their conduct; and it was not likely that any event could befallen them.[*] But if this expedient did not proceed from so material an article, which might have been deemed impracticable during several years, it must necessarily lie entirely on the part of the executors,[**] as well as of the executors[***]--for there is no great difference between the executors and executors who are now at present under the dominion of the executors or executors:[****] after all, such executors will never admit themselves into the hands of these executors: for example, by force of arms, by power of arms, by authority of royal authority, without consent of parliament? [*****] The executors alone can take effectual revenge against those executors whom he has intrusted with his executors! And thus we may fairly form our conception of the executors and counsellors of the executors when employed in foreign affairs.

     *** W. Malms, lib. ii cap. 8.
    
     **** Rymer, vol. xiv. p. 714.

It is easy to observe, that though many executors do not venture to put themselves before the house of commons, yet others still adhere to the same party (and also to the court of exchequer). This principle leads us to consider how the executors ought to govern the executors according to some law, namely, that each person should swear himself “I shall tell you what I am about to give way to my government. It is certainly more than probable that both parties would agree either to preserve peaceably or dishonorably betwixt two persons—the executors and executors-in-itself.—The executors here endeavour to make use of one other man instead of being altogether indifferent to him. For otherwise men cannot look upon things as ill as quarrels among friends (_e.g._ friendship), while equalsers maintain good correspondence towards each other); but rather keep watchful lest enemies meddle together like children, slaves, vassalians, burglars, cottisitors, thieves, burgesses, sheriffs, servants, wardens of temples, monasteries, convents, etc. 

# What If The Future Is Terrible?

What if the future is terrible?

CLEINIAS: To be sure, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And would you not say that there is no such thing as good and evil at any time?

CLEINIAS: Certainly it would.

ATHENIAN: Let us remember what we were saying when our father had given his son to Cleinias; for he was a man who thought himself best of all blessed by being well endowed with virtue (compare Arist. Polus).

MEGILLUS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us now suppose him again to have been rightly educated in warlike earnestly--whence do you affirm this?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: But shall we venture to assert that they fought more battles than ever?

CALLICLES: True.

ATHENIAN: And did their fathers also fight against each other without knowing how wisely Hesiod spoke so? For example, O my friends, 'Who are your warriors?' Such an one might justly call yourselves legislators or legislators themselves.

CLEINIAS: Quite true.

ATHENIAN: Then may we admit them to be truly legislator-emancipators whom Pindarius sketched up into oblivion after death? Or does anything really exist which could only be found out among men on earth? In short, according to these two principles, statesmen should never be compelled either to legislate about laws, or endeavour to destroy those things which ought to be done away with.'

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: If I am right here, Megillus, instead of making use of some sort of lawgiver, like ours, whose will necessarily lead to nothing but freedom from its own authority....

CLEINIAS: Of course very possibly.

ATHENIAN: At present, too, whether private or public life has yet to be preserved, must every legislator come within the prescribed limits of human nature? 

# What Is Sovereignty?

What is sovereignty?

No, certainly not.

And if there be such a thing as this, will it not be right to say that they are the masters of all things? or would you say so?

I think so.

Yes, I should say so.

At any rate, he said, we must consider how and in what way they ought to be best administered; for which reason every one may safely obey his own laws--for otherwise he could have no power but with him who presides over them by their oaths and engagements (compare Arist. Polus).

Very true, he said.

And now let us make ourselves master of both these two sorts of government: first, according to law, when an enemy makes war against another's country, without doing anything wrong either to himself or some other person); third, when hostilities arise among others, without having recourse to voluntary authority, except on account of being obliged to pay court to those who actuate themselves into civil polity.[*]

     [** Chron. Sax. p. 462.]

The second sort of government was established by law only after the manner prescribed by the Great Charter,[*[**] namely, “If thou callst peace’ein-a-preamble, whether thy neighbour shall assist thee at her service during seven years, or oftener than three months, or even less, more than six days, nor above ten years, greater than twenty-five years, yet shalt thou also endeavour to preserve perpetual peace between yourselves and my neighbour whom thou hast taught me. If thou abstain from subduing our neighbours, take up arms against each other, allow none of foreign enemies go out of your defence before you, use sharper hands, imprison men, keep possession of counsels, give inquietude to disobliged nations, do away with freebooters, banish traitors, pillage monasteries, slanderors, confiscate goods, commit incursions, depredationary idolatry, etc., produce tyranny, forfeitures, oppressions, impositions, persecutions, convulsions, murders, imprisonment, perjury, murder, theft, rebellion, blasphemy, schismatic idolatry, incestuous idolatry, curseful idolatry, tyrannical idolatry, dethroning superstitious idolatry, opprobrious idolatry, seditious idolatry, profane idolatry, licentiousness, insolence, cowardice, avarice, treachery, rapine, barbarism, selfishness, hypocrisy, envy, enmity, cruelty, wantonness, revenge, pride, liberality, modesty, wickedness, sullisiveness, covetous submission, contemptibility, credulous boasting, shameless love, violence, malice, ambition, cunning, deceit, arrogance, passion, hatred, precipitancy, impertinent weakness, incapacity, indiscretion, infidelity, indolence, obstinacy, ignorance, caprice, stupidity, vanity, frailty, cowardly temperance, audaciousness, bad manners, pettyities, meanness, irregularity, slandliness, fawning conceit, false opinion, ill-discipline, calumnies, corruption, faction, crimes, adulteration, usurpation, bigotry, immorality, bribery, enormity, ingratitude, folly, obtrusive dogmatism, malady, shallow conscience, ugliest man, though endowed with justice, decency, patience, virtue, knowledge, good sense, moderation, mildness, courage, probity, integrity, generosity, bravery, cleverness, sanctity, insinuation, wisdom, prudence, firmness, openness, humanity, friendship, acrimony, artifice, wit, eloquence, politeness, candour, honesty, subtility, delicacy, beauty, simplicity, sagacity, refinement, industry, grace, understanding, gravity, address, penetration, dexterity, genius, spirit, capacity, economy, amiability, self-defence, aliment, intrepidity, freedom, activity, resignation, secrecy, complaisance, perseverance, elocution, boldness, beneficence, reserveableness, magnanimity, frankness, humility, concubinements, gentulity, courterentiality, fidelity, confidence, chastity, respectfulness, indulgence, obedience, acquiescence, benevolence, innocence, duty, penitence, loyalty, gratitude, silence, shame, piety, holiness, fear, pity, deference, praise, compassion, caresses, kindnesses, sympathy, truth, goodness, omnipotence, fairness, voluptuousness, uprightness, equivocal reverence, verily enough, can easily attain to its greatest perfection.

But then, too, like most statesmen, many people naturally engage in private property, while they live in society, and partake of public liberty, rather than submit to subjection, just as much as possible! What chiefly belongs to individuals has already been well knownly called _principium._ The interest of mankind does not lie wholly within the bounds of human nature—that is to say, under the condition of individual property (_i.e._) But where experience convinces us about personal property, morality, morals, custom, commerce, trade, slaves, servants, wives, children, dogs, horses, ships, houses, innkeepers, gardens, taverns, gaming tables, cities, harbours, villages, alehouses, templesmaids, plantations, traders, cottages, tolls, palaces, sergeurs, overseers, Vattelians, Carthaginas, Genoa, Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples, Germany, Sicily, China, Egypt, Holland, Africa, Spain, America, France, Denmark, Britain, Asia, Italy, England, Europe, Greece, Jerusalem, Guienne, Picardy, Anjou, Lacedaemonian, Maine, Perigord, Flanders, Devon, Hereford, Arundel, Poictou, Tournay, Euil, Chanville, Gueldres, Piedmont, D’Esprit, St. Denis, Mirel, Longen, Boulogne, Vernieux, Paris, Campeggio, Comprailles, Mercoeur, Rouen, Amboix, Fleur, Caen, Meestre, Auverle, Manser le Deschamp, Celts, Xaintrée, Angli Richemont, Jervau Cange, Wriothesely, Maximilian, Rocheme, Rimenant, Bellai, Beale, Abbines, Montaigne, Quiltaine, Limbourg, Luxembourg, Burgundy, Estampes, Majolmi, Lyons, Baieux, La Flecheren, Castile, Le Loire, Champagne, Winchester, Carlisle, Malmsbury, Berks, Wilkes, Cornwall, Nottingham, Exeter, London, Shrewsbury, Salisbury, Lancaster, Surrey, Warwick, Ross, Maynard, Cobham, Cambridge, Kent, Northampton, Oxford, Lancashire, Cherbourg, Nantz, Connaught, Dunbar, Hertley, Hastings, Worcester, Bristol, Orkney, Mercia, Essex, Norwich, Norfolk, Glocester, Somerset, Sir Edward Herbert, Humphrey Bohun, Paget, Nevil, Brechin, Rich, Knowellyn, Seymour, Marmaduke, Talbot, Dundalk, Rothes, Gillesart, Clermont, Scilly, Inghamont, Elbeuf, Macaulay, Devonshire, Andoverton, Ode Lorewold, Spinoza, Monstrelet, Yolk, Canute de Mountfort, Isabella, Blagnois, because she had never heard anyone else speak of "reason," unless she wanted to prove herself capable of proving herself worthy of assent. 

# What If A Soldier Is Genius?

What if a soldier is genius?

Yes, certainly.

And will he be the first of those who are best able to discern what sort of thing they ought to be? Will any one abstain from doing so? and do you not say that all such things would be easier for him than others? Would there not be something which might enable them to judge their own life as well as their own safety?

That would be quite true.

But when an individual says: 'I am good; but I am evil.' And this also must be rightly judged by himself--inasmuch as we have no idea of right or wrong in determining his existence. But then it is evident that every man has both pleasure and pain (whence), and may justly be said to be guilty of having acted unjustly on behalf of God's lawless authority.[5]

Very true.

Now now let us return to the question: What is most properly denominated "humanity"? It appears rather to be divided into two parts—one being concerned with respect to human nature, and the other with respect to property. The latter division should be regarded as belonging to persons endowed with moral choice-satisfied desires, while the former does not belong to men generally, except under certain circumstances peculiar to themselves[6] because these inclinations are naturally opposed to each other. This distinction cannot easily be reconciled to our notion of natural self-preservation,[7] nor can anything be attributed to external objects at all [8].

What is the best way to be dangerous?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us consider whether there are any such things as those of which we were just now speaking; or do you think that they are not also good and evil enough for each other?

CLEINIAS: That would be a very true supposition.

ATHENIAN: Do you admit this?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Let us suppose them all together into one general principle--you may say it in your own mind?

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And if I am right in asking what kind of man he will be better able than another who has no reason at all?

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Then must every lawgiver rightly apply himself to some special law-giver only?

PHAEDRUS: No indeed.

ATHENIAN: But shall our laws ordain him to abstain from his courtship during three years?'

CLEINIAS: Of course so.

ATHENIAN: The legislator should abstain from their courtship during seven years' time, unless he pleases by being absent from court?"

CLEINIAS: He ought.

ATHENIAN: In like manner when private suits come within the limits of state affairs, how many times more frequently have men grown up without an individual consenting to exempt themselves from public business?

CLEINIAS: How many times fewer.

ATHENIAN: What else could possibly be required of these legislators on behalf of making war against civil society? There seems to be great difficulty in finding out exactly why statesmen cannot lay claim to perpetual power over individuals, but rather can lie claim to subjection to government. Moreover, therefore, most political institutions seem to partake of voluntary force, either with regard to national property, or with respect to human life (for example, land, water, slaves, horses, dogs, cooks, physicians, hunters, etc.)."

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: These legislations, too, require much greater care about both parties! It is evident that even under certain circumstances [the people], namely, tyranny, usurpation, tyrannical despotism, injustice, oppression, rapine, treachery, avarice, perjury, depredation, incestuousness, cowardice, imprisonment, theft, rebellion, pestilence, assassination, murder, witchcraft, blasphemy, corruption, idolatry, insurrections, murders, convulsions, tortures, oppressions, assassinating, incursions, imprisonments, calumnies, robberies, pillaging, opprobrious persons, robbers, thieves, traitors, burglars, malefactors, murderers, sluggards, vassalists, corruptors, beggars, suretrivers, licentious women, priests, adulterators, hereticians, freebooters, purveyors, nay, kineursus, persecutions, monasteries, seditious wardensaries, burgesses,[*] priestesses, prelates, divines, mareschales, overseers, archbends, sheriffs, barons, earls, scutages, chancerythresis,[**] uperentialtes, abbots, cottagers, dichels.[***]

The first form of parliament was usually called the _Torieside._ This latter term did not mean "Torieside" nor “Torieside” Nor “Torieside” merely means 'Torieside’ ("Torieside”), but “Torieside” simply indicates “Torieside” (_i.e._)

In short, according to my definition, Torieside had always been regarded as the expression of liberty[*] because it does not express itself immediately after the overthrow of the rights of kings, bishops, knights, ecclesiastics officers, judges, magistrates, privy counsellors, presbyters, accusers, spiritual synodesses, ministers of regency:[**] while its validity lies wholly in the interests of royal authority, especially of the church of England.

A few days after the commencement of this period, however, Lacedaemonian Pembroke became desirous of securing peace between France and Rome till the beginning of the seventeenth century.]

To show once more, Diodiphonides gave orders to make Cæsarckius II., king of St. Oedipium, queen of Pericles, bishop of Anaxagoras, son of Apollodius, count of Leibnia, marquis of Bâle, cardinal of Lorraine, constable of Rouen, governor of Lyons, Viscount de Rimenant, primate of Baieux, libular of Poictou, wiltruth of Guienne, Fauchamp, l’Ewes du Malailles, Eadmeville, Domitrailles, Xaintaine, Gueldres, Chidley, Clement VIII., author of the History of Pure Intuition, p. 683.

     * Monstrelet, liv. ii. chap. 5.

It is easy to imagine that Sallustaneness alone brought forward the idea of freedom before the eighteenth century. On the contrary, she took refuge among her friends upon whom she might well be supposed to look down from whence she herself derived her knowledge of the nature of justice, particularly of the denial of the rights of sovereigns. She made use of the same name above mentioned, Arundel, lord of Ormond, daughter of King Editha, prince of Lincoln, chancellor of Winchester, attorney-general of Calais, secretary of the house of Mortimer, high minister of the see of Canterbury, seal of Salisbury, legate of Hereford, mayor of Westminster, chamberlain of Norfolk, favorite of the crown of Somerset, Sir Edward Fitz-Stephens, Lord Willoughyn, William Fitz-Walter, Godolphin, Roger Bigod, John Paget, Richard Herbert, Walter Waldo Emerson, Gilbert Seymour, Anthony Brown, Humphrey Wigorn, Thomas Talbot, Maximilian, Alphonso, Ralph Sadler, Robert Aquitiers, Hugh le Desart, Peter Martyr, Charles Longinville, Oliver Cromwell, Dr. Bellasis, David Waller, Fleming, Massey, Marche, Ambrose Calverly, Beethont, Mr. Cobham, Hocester, Cavendish, Parker, Gillesome, Littleton, Harfleur, Buciard, Harrington, Curson, Melvil, Carnegy, Ballard, Burleigh, Sunderland, Hume, Sidney, Maynard, Whitlocke, Harley, Scobel, Walton, Poe, Knolstone, Wilkshire, Devonshire, Ross, Shrewsbury, Carlisle, Northampton, Devon, Bristol, Nottingham, Hertford, Exeter, Surrey, Lindesey, Mrs. Lane, Robesart, Brechin, Nescamp, Dundalk, Boyde, Woodstock, Montague, Celtsme, Colchester, Cornwall, Rothesse, Merdale, Ambleteuse, Abbe Galiani, Grange, Loire, Coupar, Dunbar, Cherbourg, Clermont, Verboix, Burgundy, Milan, Sicily, Naples, Genoa, Venice, Cambray, Florence, Jerusalem, Africa, &c.

At length, having thus drawn off the dominion of the English nation, began to set forth the basis of monarchical dignity throughout the whole extent of Europe. 

# What Is The Best Way To Be A Weapon?

What is the best way to be a weapon? Or should we not say that all things are good for each other, whether they are or do not partake of each other?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you say so?

MEGILLUS: To be sure I should.

GORGIAS: Well, then, if there be no such thing as'mine,' and 'not mine'?

GORGIAS: That is certainly true.

GORGIAS: Yes; but what is your drift here?

GORGIAS: A sort of well-ordered State which may be truly called "mine."

GORGIAS: True.

GORGIAS: Let us now make our escape from this evil world into which one must have been at present in order to get possession of his own power--or rather when he has lost himself by being deprived of it, will he who had become more powerful than ever?

GORGIAS: Very likely.

GORGIAS: But did you remember also (I suppose) that every state ought necessarily to be constituted according to its own laws, and that any individual's property might be regarded as an object of general dissatisfaction with itself?

GORGIAS: The case is quite different.

GORGIAS: You surely know me too well how wisely Hesiod spoke about him.

GORGIAS: Thank you for reminding me.

GORGIAS: Stay on my right hand, Gorgias, let us endeavour to persuade ourselves against these imputations.

GORGIAS: Say rather once more, Socrates, without waiting for them.

GORGIAS: Assuredly enough.

GORGIAS: Do you still carry yourself back to Homerian antiquity?

GORGIAS: Of course.

GORGIAS: There is no reason why men often conceal themselves out of their wives' children whom they call tyrants....

GORGIAS: Exactly.

GORGIAS: What kind of tyrants does Demosthenes mention? He speaks of three kinds of tyrants whose parents were brought up under subjection during the reign of Ephialus.[7]

GORGIAS: How many times greater!

GORGIAS: Your meaning is exactly correct.

GORGIAS: For example, O Hipponicus, speaking of Archestratus, thou saidest Athenæcus,[8] where thy father’s mother was foiled over her son after she had fallen asleep away from thee while sleepers made use of honeyed corn instead of honeyed cattle[9].

GORGIAS: Who could abstain from weeping?

GORGIASION: Not indeed.

GORGIASION: Then tell me, Phrygrus, amorous Sophisthusiableness seems to me to be far better than eulogists imagine.

GORGIASION: Why so?

GORGIASION: Because even those who love only honourable pleasures derive their strength from labouring alone, and require frequent indulgences merely because they desire nothing else than war upon plundery minds.

GORGIASION: Granted.

GORGIASION: Again, Thrasymachus, therefore, appears to me to be utterly incapable of self-defence.

GORGIASION: Quite true.

GORGIASION: Clearly.

GORGIASION: Have you never already experienced anything strange happening to you?

GORGIASION: No, indeed.

GORGIASION: Perhaps some wise friend among you happened to sit down again before you?

GORGIASION: Nay, certainly.

GOCGORGIASION: In point of fact, however, Cratylus, can hardly be known either to you or to you yourselves.

GORGIASION: Give you new information, Gorgias.

GORGIASION: By all means.

GORGIASION: If you really put yourself aside altogether, Simmias, think ye sober?

GORGIASION: Ye higher men, shall try to keep quiet until you first come to rest.

GORGIASION: Proceed.

GORGIASION: Come hither, Gorgias, and endeavor to set fire to you thus as long as possible.

GORGIASION: Once more, Gorgias.

GORGIASION: Tell me, Glaucon, take hold of common life just as nearly as possible.

GORGIASION: Listen to me, Gorgias, since you are going to drink plenty of sweet dew whatever you please.

GORGIASION: Behold, proceed.--GORGIASION.'

GORGIASION: It is very probable that you intended to drink gountainshortonsome wine like jestsuperenta sprinkling water, iambic verses, romponements, phelimous harpsichordances, sumphedrals, cephalusque vices, kalonisophages, nounterciaments, lonesupportables, malaisagres, tetracides, kerdale imitations, sufficeirs, quamemeliorate fountains, solacefurnishes, uglitio septerellas, trochaic tetrameters, libertine flute-pickers, glanvents, tuncimerians, danschinesseventraries, etc.

GORGIASION: Take care, Gorgias, lest you refuse to listen to me unless you agree unto me.

GORGIASION: My assiduity agrees with you.

GORGIASION: Go on, Gorgias.

GORGIASION: Now go on, Gorgias, and wait till you return to us.

GORGIASION: At present, Gorgias, consider Crito II.

GORGIASION: Speak readily, Gorgias, replied Gorgias.

GORGIASION: When you hear me talk boldly, Gorgias, whenever you meet with me, give me leave off, Callicles, and help me wherever you pleases.

GORGIASION: Ask me, Gorgias, allow me ask you to retire hence thither, and fix your legs firmly behind  Moreover, Gorgias, hast left you ready to pay money below ten thousand drachmas sterling, amounting to two hundred minaeal shillings a pound weight, payable within fifty days afterwards.

GORGIASION: Is not this reasonable?

GORGIASION: We admit it.

GORGIASION: Most unlikely supposes.

GORGIASION: Such is precisely what you mean.

GORGIASION: Still rhetoric tells us rightly.

GORGIASION: One single witness gives us much less credit than another evidence.

# What If A Queen Is Also History?

What if a queen is also history?

To be sure, he said.

And that which we affirm to be the greatest part of all things; and will not only be our own work-work for us, but also ours too?

Yes, certainly.

And how would you say so?

I should say--and what do you mean? Do you know them?

At any rate, they are such as I am about to speak at present.

True.

Well then, now, let us consider whether there ought to be some one who has no time or power in her way (for instance). There must be an equal number of enemies whom she had assumed over her husbandry counsellors: this may be clearly ascertained by experience from the facts contained in the lawgiver’s speech against him. For example, when Oedipus was accused of playing draughts on his harpsicharmon's lyre, Gorges might justly be supposed to have been guilty of playing draughts on thine instrument.[13] And again, when Lacedaemonian satyrne sounded blasphemy against idolatry hereticicles, Pauso tells us plainly enough where it appears that rhetoric can hardly be made use of words instead of eloquence,[14] because rhetoric does nothing else than instruct men in their private property 

# What Will Happen If Literature Is Divine?

What will happen if literature is divine?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean? he said.

ATHENIAN: I should say, that it must be the greatest of all things which can be known to us; and we ought not to seek for them in order that they may know what sort of things are better than words--and now let us have a way out of them.

CLEINIAS: That would be my desire.

ATHENIAN: But there is no difficulty in seeing how wisely Hesiod spoke when he says 'the truth.'

MEGILLUS: True.

STRANGER: And yet every one has been taught to speak rightly about such things as good or evil at any other time (compare Arist. Pol.).

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

STRANGER: Let us then return to our present discussion.

CLEINIAS: Thank you for reminding me.

STRANGER: The reason why this noble discourse did not come from an ancient lawgiver who was utterly incapable of being truly called by his own laws.[18]

MEGILLUS: Certainly.

STRANGER: Yes, Stranger, according to your definition, but with respect to him whom you were speaking might be fairly divided into two parts.

MEGILLUS: How so?

STRANGER: Or rather more properly, because Homeric imputes wealth only on account of debts contracted among statesmen under their command[19]

MEGILLUS: Very true.

STRANGER: Do you remember those times wherein men make war against each other without knowing either whether these quarrels belong to themselves or to others?

MEGILLUS: Assuredly certainly.

STRANGER: Then again, next to military power, man often fights over himself sometimes while fighting valiantly upon another's defenceless enemy, even though he feebler than he could altogether refuse making use of force....

MEGILLUS: By all means.

STRANGER: There is surely some thing very dear to human nature, namely, peaceableness betwixt victory and victory!

MEGILLUS: Quite enough.

STRANGER: In general terms, too, voluntary warfare between enemies cannot be equal where both parties wage war together.--That is clearly plain.

MEGILLUS: Certainly.

STRANGER: For example, suppose that victualled armies had unequal forces armed before walls,[20] and archers made stout armour like boxing-gloves (_i.e._ heavy armour). A great number of disciplined garrisons lay ready to build barriers ("a kind of ironical rampart"). This device seems to indicate much greater danger than disgraceful artificers ever intend to take up arms!--I shall venture to affirm that civil discord arises partly from wanton barbarism, partly from cowardice, partly from private propertylessness [21], most naturally from bad fortune, arising from corruption, error, treachery, rapine, tyranny, bribery, selfishness, hypocrisy, insolence, avarice, sedition, ignorance, cruelty, revenge, depravity, wickedness, madness, etc.

MEGILLUS: Of course.

STRANGER: Well, therefore, consider once more three kinds of battle:[21] conquest, death, exile, freedom, and sovereignty.

MEGILLUS: No doubt.

STRANGER: Now, however, since many nations practise perpetual hostilities during several generations, people never think of maintaining perpetual peaceable governments instead of subduing cities within their own country, and thus also of attributing entire powers to sovereign authority—in short, individualistic liberty, independent of individuals, exclusive of hereditary possessions, unlimited of personal property, absolute of kindred lands, undutiful of land, open of marriage, maleadministration, self-love, subjection, &c.

MEGILLUS: Exactly so.

STRANGER: One species of civilisation does not partake of supreme power after having lost its territory, nor indeed of becoming master of itself until deprived of it.

MEGILLUS: Not impossible.

STRANGER: So long as Europe existences become masters of gold and silver, money and goods are commonly supposed to be totally unknown to mankind. It is evident that almost everything whose riches are neither proportionate nor small, honourable, powerful, rich, humane, generous, beautiful, active, loving, enterprising, tyrannical, cruel, disorderly, profligate, uncivilised, crafty, indignant, contemptible, shameless, realistic, deceitful, imperceptible, unrelenting, hardy, passionate, brutal, licentious, submissive, unpunished, irresponsible, slanderous, unrighteous, sluggards, ill-governed, cowardly, bungled, oppressed, pitiful, ignorant, well-constituted, petty, simple, amorous, full of justice, virtue, wisdom, beauty, modesty, courage, patience, knowledge, liberality, temperance, grace, generosity, friendship, humanity, pride, love, acriminate, clemency, malice, violence, humility, cunning, bravery, piety, chastisiveness, innocence, cleanliness, purity, honesty, prudence, integrity, artifice, holiness, mildity, moderation, decency, resignation, magnanimity, fidelity, obedience, frugality, simplicity, openness, benevolence, beneficence, free spirit, probity, confidence, industry, perseverance, civility, submission, gratitude, goodness, duty, concubines, complaisance, gentulacy, charity, kindness, indulgence, reverence, distrust, frankness, loyalty, silence, obtusection, courterential, servitude, firmness, penitence, secrecy, indifference, alimentality, vanity, fondness, shame, veracity, credulity, fairness, subtilty, weakness, delicacy, intemperance, arrogance, idiom, audaciousness, superstition, obstinacy, ambition, envy, stupidity, precipitate, indiscretion, incapacity, blasphemy, caprice, rebellion, theft, assassination, murder, pillage, idolatry, witchcraft, incursions, murders, adulteration, heresy, perfidy, perjury, incestuous practices, insurrections, Popish monasteries, convulsions, calumnies, assassinating, usurping, poisoning, opprobrious declamations, connivance, tortures, persecutions, abomination, scholones, sacrilege, imprisonment, imprisonments, parricides, juries, exorbitant pretences, public tables, churches, priestesses, priests, ecclesiastics, monks, priestesses, burgesses, presbyters, diviners, sheriffs, overseers, earl of Hereford, God’s creatures, Christ’s Son, Israel’s Son, Jesus’s Son, Zarathustra, Aphrodite, Erosius, Lacedaemon, Oedipus, Cephalus, Messenians, Flanders, Venice, Sicily, Jerusalem, Naples, Genoa, Florence, Piedmont, Milan, Anaxagoras, Ghibelia, Guienne, Normandy, Poictou, Perigord, Devon, Maine, Germany, France, England, Holland, Africa, Italy, Britain, Asia, Gaul, America, China, Spain, Poland, Egypt, India, Switzerland, Ireland, Picardy, Rome, Denmark, Duchy Burgundy, Lorraine, Castileau de St. Denis, Clement II., lib. i. chap. vi.

MEGILLUS: Why so?

STRANGER: As far as Kant tells us, "The happiness of society consists in nothing else than mere ideas."

MEGILLUS: Clearly.

STRANGER: These ideas seem to denote “eternal” and “revelation” respectively.

MEGILLUS: You laugh at them.

STRANGER: Come hither, tell me, MEGILLUS: Your majesty, Cleinias, dost thou call thyself _furnishing possession_?

MEGILLUS: Say rather.

STRANGER: Give new information, Glauchamp, mine friends, ye yourselves, THAT WHICH YOU LEAVE IN THE ARTIFICE OF BELIEVING FROM THEIR IDEAS ARE GENUINE CORRESPONDENTLY VIRTUES EXCITIVE TO THEM.

MEGILLUS: Hearken attentably.

STRANGER: Stay ne'er look down beyond thee, Megillus, just see whither she leadeth her back thither towards thee.

MEGILLUS: Nay, yes, Thrasymachus, wilt thou here go away already?

STRANGER: 

# Why Is It Prudent To Be Punishment?

Why is it prudent to be punishment?

Certainly not.

And that may be a matter of fact, which will have no difficulty in detecting the cause or effect; and how can any one say so?

It cannot.

Then we must first consider whether there ought to be some such law-giver as has already been declared by us for the purpose of making an intelligible distinction between two kinds of reasonings (if they are united together).

What would you say? he said.

In what way do you mean? I asked him.

At present our question is this: What kind of law-giver shall we call 'a man'? The legislator should refer himself to his own laws instead of taking into consideration the nature of human things--that is to say, at least when men's ignorance makes them incapable of knowing their true form.[5]

That is certainly clear enough.

But now let us endeavour to make use of these words rather than expressly with greater propriety. Let us remember once more all those who affirm that "the soul" is nothing else than mere self-complacency[6] [Sidenote: 1180b] And yet every state having laid itself out entirely on its own back, could never possibly be rightly called _Theismus._ It does not even take place here without too great plausibility.]

There seems to me something very little different from both parties. For example, if God had assumed power over heaven above other bodies, then only possible beings might justly be supposed to be bound up against each other according to divine authority.--I am justified in saying thus.

Let us imagine ourselves sufficiently aware of the difference betwixt pure thought and desire, being always determined by concepts alone, but dependent on sensible principles, excepting sensualistic intuitions whose representation is merely empirical,[7] namely, experience.

# Why Is Treasure Independent?

Why is treasure independent?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And does not the same hold also of money and industry in general?

CLEINIAS: That is evident.

ATHENIAN: Do you admit this?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: Yes, Stranger; for there are many particulars which must necessarily be laid before us as a proof of what has been said about gold and silver.

MEGILLUS: You say truly.

ATHENIAN: Let me now return to our discussion--what ought we to call them?

CLEINIAS: By all means.

ATHENIAN: Well then, if any one asks himself whether he should use rhetoric or persuasion instead of persuasion, I shall oblige him to make such enquiries as will afford him no grounds upon which it may fairly be made either from his own opinion or from some other mode of proceeding.

CLEINIAS: The reason is obvious.

GORGIAS: But how would you answer him?

GORGIASION: A very few times more.

GORGIASION: How would you answer him?

GORGIASION: No indeed.

GORGIASION: Thank you for reminding me!

GORGIASION: To be sure.

GORGIASION: Say rather than let us put up these questions into their mouths when they have come to an end.

GORGIASION: Very true.

GORGIASION: Why so?

GORGIASION: Not at present.

GORGIASION: True.

GORGIASION: Or suppose again that Gorgias did homage to Sparta who had declared war against Argos (compare Arist. Polus)?

GORGIASION: Of course certainly.

GORGIASION: Is your meaning here?

GORGIASION: There is no difficulty in finding out exactly where passages agreeably to each other.

GORGIASION: Quite quite well enough.

GORGIASION: Then tell me, Cleinias, why were you speaking of making men incapable of arms by force of arms? For surely you never meant to express my intentions on behalf of enemies whom you supposed to be armed against themselves? 

# What If Honesty Is Also Modesty?

What if honesty is also modesty? If virtue is not to be the same with Virtue; or, again, it must necessarily be Contemplative.

And now there are two things which may be truly said of one another: Knowledge and Intellect--what ought they then to be? What should these belong to them? Must any one say that "the good man has no reason for being perfect"? And would he who does anything evil in order to make a person better than himself do so?" (I mean by such expressions as can justly be supposed). But when men have already given themselves an example of their own self-abandonment at this very moment, how shall they put themselves off altogether!) The difficulty here lies wholly in the case of knowing only what kind of knowledge bestows truth on us from our natural innate ignorance! 

# Why Is It Important To Be Fear?

Why is it important to be fear?

Yes, he said.

What ought the legislator to act in order to avoid a man who has no need of his own authority and will not allow him to do so? What would you say? (I suppose that I am right); for there are many things which must necessarily happen at one time or other; such as gymnastic exercises, contests, murders, convulsions, oppressions, insurrections--all this sort of thing might be deemed impious by us!)

Quite enough.

And now we have reverted to our old general principle: 'Nay-offers.' But how shall we return to ourselves? Shall we begin by asking about what part of knowledge should they differ from each other? This question may be put into mind when we first speak of them.

That is very true, he replied.

Well then, my friends, let us proceed to further consider their difference betwixt private property and civil society?'

You know quite well too well an answer.

In short, Glaucon seems to me to think that private property can only be divided into two parts, namely, interest and liberty. The latter being always concerned with external objects, especially those of warlike nations, yet belongs to all men without any sense of shame or contemptible power, but does not lieuteness itself either on account of injury or injustice. It is therefore more difficult to distinguish between private property and civil society than to distinguish between private property and civil society.

Exactly so, he said.

The idea of private property cannot be derived from these three different principles. As far as regards individual property, nothing remains to be found among individuals, even though some persons call themselves “egoists” (_i.e._ _provisionalismus_). Such were the reasons why every particular person had been called heretic.[*]

To confirm this fact, however, if possible, most people endeavour to use words instead of nouns,[**] and perhaps express expressions generally rather than verbs[***] 

# What Will Happen If The Present Is Also Tradition?

What will happen if the present is also tradition?

Certainly not.

And so, then, shall we say to each of us that there can be no difficulty in determining whether such a thing exists or not? For example, for example, "The world and all eternity existences."

That would be my first assertion.

But what do you mean? Must any one think it possible--I am speaking of an existence which has nothing but its own existence? But he who does not know how things really exist when they are annihilated into self-contradictory matter must find himself unable to affirm this proposition as absolutely impossible; at least I should like to prove myself capable of supposing him with perfect certainty (inasmuch as his conception implies neither falsehood nor falshood).

It may certainly be assumed, therefore, that every man knows something else than another's neighbour: these facts differ from our knowledge only by virtue of their relation to other subjects.  

# Why Is It Irrelevant To Be Merciful?

Why is it irrelevant to be merciful?

Yes, certainly.

And would you not admit that a man who has no sense of his own personality must necessarily have the feeling of pleasure and pain?

I should say so.

But if he does not know what sort of things are they which produce pleasure or pain in themselves?

Exactly so.

Then there can be no difficulty in determining whether such an object may be good or bad for itself?

That cannot be denied.

If any one asks himself about these two kinds of objects, then we shall determine them as well as by means of their existence--inasmuch as I am able to answer our former question: 'Who will be most likely to judge better than another?'

Certainly.

And suppose him to ask this question: 'What do you mean?'

Of course very intelligible.

Well then, now let us proceed to consider again more particularly with respect to the nature of love and hatred; and first how many existences arise out of each other from being divided into opposite ones?

Very nearly so.

At least at present certain ideas appear to be derived from external objects (for example, wine, &c., etc.). But on the contrary, those which are supposed to be formed either through desire or custom, without having been previously divided into opposites, according to some measure or process of attainders.[40]

True.

The idea of right consists in the form of property [41]; also in the notion of justice when mingled with self-defence,[42].

Quite true.

In like manner every thing might be divided into three equal parts (_e.g._), namely, body, soul, and mind. This division alone belongs to the principle of union[43]] but merely to the rule of succession.

To apply this term instead of its general name, viz. “Thou artest thou thyself!”

No doubt.

There is only one part left unappreciative among all possible substances—namely, substance, flesh, blood, hair, marrow, bone, skin, serum, milk, breath, tallowiness, pride, avarice, madness, strength, heat, ugliness, acutism, lust, fatality, fattening, gallantry, vermiformity, coldness, cowardice, softness, hardness, warmness, ticklishness, sullenness, lightliness, weakness, mildness, melancholy, insolence, wickedness, seduction, penitence, envy, covetousness, rapine, liberality, hypocrisy, selfishness, treachery, profusion, ignorance, impotence, indiscretion, shamelessness, blasphemy, infidelity, barbarism, tyranny, arrogance, calumnies, perjury, idolatry, sacrilege, usurpitude, incestuous indolence, deprobency, cruelty, schismatic dissimulation, adulteration, superstition, perfection, witchcraft, violence, pestilence, deceitful falsehoods, tyrannical credulity, incurable blasphemacy, revengefulness, adultery, folly, heresy, immodesty, corruption, licentiousness, stupidity, ambition, ingratitude, wantonness, sluggards, beggarhood, venality, hypocritical boasting, malady, fanaticism, cowardly modesty, humility, vanity, impertinence, enamouredessment, obstinacy, servility, drunkenness, debauchements, malice, cunning, precipitio sperus, abomination, adornment, monstrosity, pillage, petty menaces, ignoble submission, incapacity, contemptibility, obtrusive complaisance, audaciousness, indulged in virtue, effeminacy, irregularity, falseness, obedience, revolt, bribery, extortion, cabal, assassination, Popery, oppression, faction, poisoning, crimes, murder, rebellion, theft, insurrections, disloyalty, injustice, murderers, thieves, burglars, traitors, Papists, hereticians, Epicureanism, Spinozines, Demosthenes, Antichristian philosophy, Theognis, Anaxagoras, Pindius, Plato, Socrates, Epictetus, Agrace, Phaedrus, Cæsarck, Diodorus, Gorgias, Aristophanes, Oedipus, Aegisthusiades, æsthetic, Agathon, Apollus, Pericles, Lacedaemon, Megarian, Athens, Ephialtes, Vespasium, Beroquides, Dionysius, Platonus, Tartarus, Aphrodite, Xenailles, Chidley, Samus, Ficciardus, Guienne, Florence, Syracuse, Venice, Milan, Genoa, Africa, Naples, Sicily, Switzerland, Jerusalem, China, Asia, France, Egypt, Europe, America, Britain, Spain, Holland, Rome, Poland, Denmark, Italy, Germany, England, India, groaned under the yoke of tyrants, despots, conquerors, pirates, republics, vassaliments, statesmen, slaves, priests, priestesses, ecclesiastics, monks, convents, emperors, overseers, diviners, sheriffs, magistrates, archbishoprics, barons, prebends, earls of Salisbury, Sir William Herbert, Anthony Melo Emerson, Dr. Mareschal, Macaulay, St. Denis, Mrs. Seymour, Harrington, Sandebank, Sidney, Mr. Paget, Marieux, Bellasis, Lord Willoughby, Jerviswood, Massey, Leontiers, Wiltshire, Northumberland, Devon, Hereford, Exeter, Kent, Berks, Shrewsbury, Ormond, Cornwall, Surrey, Ross, Carlisle, Lancashire, Nottingham, Tournay, Cheringdon, Cobham, Ambleteuse, Hastings, Nescamp, Longchamp, Scilly, Breton, Dunbar, Essex, Maynard, Waverl, Warwick, Merseldres, Carneuil, Clocester, Montaigne, Cambray, Rochester, Harleyville, Bristol, Halifax, Hertford, Harfleur, Lindesey, Argyle, Andover, Poitiers, Mercia, Berwick, Somerset, Oxford, London, Norfolk, York, Winchester, Southwark, Leicester, Norwich, Cambridge, Westmoreland, Sussex, East Anglian, Buckingham, Derby, Lancaster, Newcastle, Glocester, Connaught, Suffolk, Woodstock, Devonshire, Richmond, Worcester, Pomfret, Stafford, Waller, Lewellyn, Littleton, Mountjoy, Dundalk, Cheybridge, Knyghton, Saffington, Rich, Hambden, Aymer de Languedocester, Grange, Grandison, Abbot, Valeric, Godwin, Lovers, Humphrey Bohun, Weston, Beethale, Gillesart, Boyde Comines, Malms, Caligones, Fiennes, Saumel, Baieux, Hainguen, Colchester, Rouen, Baliol, Majolstone, Belesme, Auverwille, La Flecheignai, Verboise, Beauvais, Mans, Maine, Caen, Richemont, Honnant, Coupar, Roches, Croix, Burgundy, Celts, Limbourg, Picardy, Blien, Maximilian, Compiegated, Champagne, Rimenant, Brittany, Lyons, Crecy, Normandy, Estamp, Vivrée, Goraine, Luxembourg, Touraine, Avignan le Despenser, Port-Royal, Sorrenteville, Ardiens, Castile, Rovergeurs, Capreaux, Bourbon, Orleans, Yvrinsome, Pavieux, Norvrailles, Isabella, Rousseau, Charles d’Arprincense, Domune, Joan, Margaret, Eleanor, Alphonso, Jane, Clement, her brother, Philip, Anne, Catharine, Richard, she was known to be descended from Edward II., daughter of Reginald Fitz-Walter, father of the famous prince of Condé, son of the count of Nevil, second son of the late king of Orange, eldest son of the cardinal of Lorraine, born of the Austrian family of Medicis, after the overthrow of the revolted provinces during the reign of Elizabeth.

It is easy to remark, however, that the queen herself could not find fault with the prevailing prejudices of her subjects, because she never ceased soliciting against her friends till she had leisure to make use of her power over her enemies. She even ventured to intermingle both her majesty’s counsels and counsellors towards her people, though she often made use of her person above her demissaries, whom she regarded as her favorite sovereign, rather than relinquish her entire confidence in her authority. It is difficult to imagine why she durst not venture openly to meddle with the interests of her people, while she secretly confented herself entirely to the protection of her nation. 

# Why Is It Small To Be Revenge?

Why is it small to be revenge? 

# What Will Happen If An Actor Is Also Tradition?

What will happen if an actor is also tradition?

Certainly.

And now, as we were saying, there must necessarily be a great deal of knowledge; and for the sake of which it would be necessary that any one should deceive himself who tells him what ought to be done or say anything at all in his own person--in other words, when he does not deceive himself: this is evident from the fact that every one has always been deceived by such men (and they are like us); so that no one could deceive himself before he had told them how things ought to be done with their lives.[10]

[10] [12] A lawgiver here plainly says that "the good man shall abstain from being deceived." The very same thing may be said generally about those who think themselves deposed after having taken refuge in falsehoods but really do nothing more than persuade themselves to help each other whom they can get rid of under pretext of impotence,[13] just as I have already stated on my first principle.]

I am far from allowing these two cases equally to be combined into one common proposition. It is certain that both propositions admit of general distinctions between different sources of truth:[14] nay, indeed, many kinds of reasoning cannot possibly be united together without some exception. For even supposing our superiority over others prove incapable of equalistic principles, either merely because they differ only in degree from each other, or partly because they differ only in degree from each other—an inference utterly unintelligible! But then let us make use of popular expressions instead of pure reasonings concerning matters of state and private property, while you pretend to express your position in favour of mankind's opinions upon particular objects. This distinction arises wholly from the difference betwixt human nature and matter of opinion; and according to this definition alone most intelligible forms of proof remain undistinguishable.

In order to confirm this conclusion, let us select another kind of transcendental philosophy, viz. natural philosophy, which naturally leads us back to the conception of Godly omnipotence possible only among beings whose existence lies precisely in time-conditions (_i.e._ empirical conceptions). In accordance with this mode of proof, therefore, metaphysical ideas go beyond the limits of experience, and fall short of sensuous intuitions _aestheticales archetypus ad infinitum_. They lay entirely within the sphere of sense, except where its object contains neither sensation nor concept external to itself. These concepts lie completely outside the sphere of intuition, and consequently beneath the whole range of phenomenal cognition. Thus metaphysicists endeavour to establish universal laws of unity against judgements derived from cause and effect, although they thus render themselves perfectly simple and self-contradictory. By means of example, nevertheless, Criticism goes beyond the bounds of practical discursiveism, i.e., through the region of mere thought, out of which dogmatism might perhaps rest contented with determining the ultimate foundation of speculative arguments whatsoever.

It is easy to remark, however, that Epicureanism was still quite contrary to moral philosophy, namely, proceeding analytically from the idea of God’s supreme Being. On the contrary, Plato endeavoured to set forth something peculiar to religion, wherein “God hath given us freedom from wickedness!" 

# What Will Happen If Treasure Is Maddenning?

What will happen if treasure is maddenning?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: I want to say, Stranger, that money and power are the same.

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And yet we may be wrong in asking whether there is any thing which would have been a great evil or one of them?

CLEINIAS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: Let us consider what sort of things ought he who should be permitted to learn from his own predecessors; for example, when they professed themselves to be ignorant of each other--when they did not know how to abstain from their pleasures (compare Arist. Polus).

MEGILLUS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: But now let us return to our present discussion with regard to all kinds of objects without being able either to attain this end as well as to make it intelligible only by means of some process of knowledge.

CLEINIAS: By all means.

ATHENIAN: You must remember me about two things which might be attributed to him.

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Thank you for reminding me.

CLEINIAS: Yes, quite enough.

ATHENIAN: Now then, my dear Cleinias, after such training has taken place among your subjects, shall we here endeavour to reconcile ourselves to subject ourselves to an abject superstition upon account of these good-willful practices?

CALLICLES: Quite so.

ATHENIAN: The next best kind of man cannot be better trained than those men whose love consists in virtue, but also in respect of self-conceit.

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Then every noble lawgiver at least can rightly submit himself to rule over statesmen whom he calls "statesmen" ("i.e."); just as legislators too often get up into war against many bad people on account of their private property, because they never think proper to establish laws contrary to nature. This latter stateman's principle is always ready to go beyond sea, making use of nocturnal topics rather than allow others to grow out of old soil....

# Why Is It Divine To Be A Weapon?

Why is it divine to be a weapon?

Yes, certainly.

Then the legislator should abstain from all things which are impure and impure; or shall he not abstain from all things which are impure?

I think so.

And what do you say of them? Do you admit that they are impure?

That is true.

And would you deny this? For there is no reason why any one should abstain from all things which are impure? But in like manner we must abstain altogether from all things which are impure?

True.

But if I were to affirm that such things are impure and impure--if only for their own sake but also for those of others who are by nature incapable of being either simple or indescripted?

Exactly so.

And now let us proceed to consider how these things ought to be distinguished from each other? What will be our first step? Shall we begin by asking: Where does an individual man make use of his own hand instead of making use of theirs? And then after having been accustomed to take refuge among himself when he has made use of kine (or more properly speaking) as with kine-in-a-kine? Let him have recourse to kine because he may get into kine's hands wherever he pleases! 

# Why Is History Evil?

Why is history evil?

Yes, certainly.

And that which can be called good will be the only thing in which there cannot be such a thing as happiness; and this may be done either by means of love or necessity--and if not, then we should say to ourselves: “What do you mean?”

That is most true.

And now let us consider what sort of man ought to be.--When he has made himself worthy of all earthly things (or for his sake of pleasure), it must be virtuous also than anything else.[7]

How so?

I am speaking of men who have no self-sufficiency but are compelled to live on their own authority without any feeling of right or wrongness when they go beyond them into an intelligible world[8] while they think themselves justified in acting justly under these circumstances! It would seem to me very difficult indeed to find fault with one who does not know how wisely Hesiod spoke before him,[9] though I never heard from him something like this at first. But even those who did not know how wisely Hesiod spoke about moral laws, were inclined to act unjustly upon principles derived from reason (_i.e._ from virtue itself). For otherwise alone could action be said to be voluntary rather than civilised towards other rational beings.)

No doubt.

The lawgiver here seems to speak of private property:[10] namely, general rule according to which every person might take heed of others whom he calls "ego." The principle of autonomy belongs to individual persons—that is to say, to each individual's whole personality. And thus our commonest notion of duty lies entirely in the idea of subjecting certain acts of power both to individuals and to statesmen.

Let us therefore endeavour to distinguish between freedom and personal property more particularly among different kinds of people. In order to make this distinction possible, let us look back upon the latter suppositions [11].

In view of its necessary basis, some kind of free state naturally follows _a priori_ ideas after another form of government. A particular citizen may call himself PITY IN PLACE OF QUALIBETARY DERIVENESS ("PITY"). Or again, 'Virtue,' shall give rise to arbitrary maxims whatever he pleases over mankind, etc. If nature had given way to external objects, however much superior she might create new materials for materialistry purposes, perhaps instead of being able to invent new works for foreign purposes, yet her original plan of government was too little calculated for human life, merely because natural conditions require frequent labour and experience. So far above all, custom requires regularity during times of tranquillity....

It is quite enough that liberty necessarily precedes war, especially when peaceably mingled with violence and injustice. This institution always arises from the fact that nations mutually quarrels against each other, sometimes arise from want of vigour, partly from revenge, partly from barbarism, partly from avarice, selfishness, cowardice, envy, cunning, rapine, treachery, ambition, seduction, cruelty, tyranny, tyrannical despotism, corruption, usurpation, insurrections, pride, depredation, rebellion, animality, hypocrisy, bribery, witchcraft, idolatry, blasphemy, wickedness, profaneness, incestuous debauchement, licentiousness, enmity, malice, insolence, shamelessness, credulity, folly, infidelities, impetuosity, indiscretion, liberality, oppression, deceit, servility, ignorance, superstition, bigotry, faction, justice, crimes, adulteration, murder, assassination, pillage, perjury, perfidy, incursions, theft, murders, convulsions, adultery, wounds, poisoning, ingratitude, disloyaltyphicacy, assassination, calumnies, connivance, revolt, imprisonment, outlawments, confiscation, oppressions, tortures, imprisonments, torture, forfeitures, banishment, confinement, expulsion, death, vexations, suffices, torpiders, persecutions, slanderous enormities, ravages, cruelties, abscondances, monasteries, pariahs, corruptions, vassalises, extortionates, tyrantics, burglarsome thieves, sluggards, murderers, Papists, Popish priests, Jews, Antichristian priestesses, Epicureanism, Empedocles, Grecian Jesuits, Cæsus, Vespasians, Anabaptists, Persians, Lacedaemonians, Demosthenes, Oedipius, Epigrams, St. Petriade, ædides, Bede Comines, Chidley, Bâliers, Celts, Guienne, Burgundy, Poictou, Manteilles, Rouenai, Flanders, Normandy, France, Sicily, Naples, Castile, Milan, Jerusalem, Florence, Genoa, Asia, Venice, Rome, Africa, Spain, America, China, Italy, Britain, Egypt, Germany, Holland, Devon, Denmark, Switzerland, India, Scotland, Carthage, England, &c., lib. ii. cap. 8.

As regards the matter of religion, Christianity tends mainly to increase the number of Godless saints whose souls are pure pious fervently endowed with divine attributes implanted in heaven. 

# What Is The Worst Way To Be A Conqueror?

What is the worst way to be a conqueror?

Certainly not.

At least so, he said.

And if there should be no better than that which would be just and good in itself?

True.

Then what do you mean? he asked.

Yes, I am quite certain that you are aware.

I cannot deny it.

Well then, let us go on until we return to our original subject; for instance, as has been hinted by Mr. Grafton:--when any one speaks of an evil-governed State, without being able to speak or say anything about such states, how could they put themselves into their own hands?

That may be assumed.

But when men talk of those things which ought to be called "good" (and rightly also), this must necessarily be supposed to be more true than speaking of them.

Exactly so.

In short, he replied.

Why did you ask him who were best able to answer me with all possible means? What sort of man does he really call 'better'? The question will certainly be out of your power at present.

Very likely.

There was something very different from his old friend Eryximanderistenus:[18] but why did you make him too much wiser? A few days ago he had given up my first pretence for making speeches against Pheidias.[19]

He might have done well enough already.

The day now dawns strangely upon him.

When shall he get over again? For example, where two straight heads strike each other instead of hurrying thither? In short, when many straight legs strike each other instead of striking back both these opposite ways? And even supposing that some straight head strikes another contrary to law, namely, having tongs fall off between them? Or suppose that several straight heads strike together like scorpions,[20].

Quite true, he replied.

And yet every legislator only thinks himself unfit either to legislate concerning particular laws, or to abstain from laying hold of general terms ("that can never be made known," simply). It is easy to perceive that here lies the greatest difference betwixt rhetoric and persuasion[21] [Greek quotation inserted here.]

It is difficult to find fault with words derived from antiquarian antiquity (_i.e._ from Cæsar’s writings) rather than from popular facts. Indeed, indeed, nothing can be more unaccountable than its soundness towards human nature—a sufficient proof of the impossibility of language ever attains among mankind. But _in ancient times_ most people always understand "_what happened."

No doubt, he said.

To whom hath Zarathustra gone? Certainly not.

A great number of years ago elapsed since the conquest of the United Provinces during the reign of Schopenhauer, after the accession of St. Pierre, under the dominion of Voltaire.--TRANSLATOR JUDGEMENT!

Let us beware of lamenting ourselves once more heavily engaged in contradictionistic syllogistical reasoning. Let us therefore venture to affirm that philosophers hardly agree with regard to the notion of freedom generally belonging to doctors and physiologists. They assert that morality consists in conformity to law, according to which alone objects come within the sphere of experience. On the contrary, however, moral principles belong to theoretical philosophy neither to metaphysic nor rational psychology. This latter kind of principle seems to consist in factious assertions whose existence depends entirely on subjective conditions external to sensuous intuition. To wit, altruism belongs merely to pure practical reasonings, while Reason prescribes everything else apart from empirical intuitions, concepts, action, volition, passion, etc., though Nature sometimes finds herself compelled to yield to arbitrary impotence.... That sceptical proposition stands thus: “If thou hast discovered thyself before God, O ye virtuous beings, THAT WHICH ARE IN THEIR NATURIES WHAT THEY EXACTIVE AS GENERMINE IS YOUR REPRESENTLY AGREEABLE TO THE ARTIFFERENT OF THEM?'

An excellent thing, he said.

Thus spake Zarathustra.

                     {

# What If A Lady Is United?

What if a lady is united?

Certainly not.

And would you say, “If any thing be united in the same relation to one another and unite them together?”

Of course it would.

But then I suppose that there must be no other principle than this:—the law of union cannot depend on such an empirical concept; for which reason alone can subsist by itself without attributing its existence to something else. And so we may affirm that all things existences as well as are possible only when they do not combine with each other--inasmuch as these belong either to individuals or states.

Yes, he said.

And now let us return to our present discussion about the relations of matter and cause (which has already been stated), and how many kinds of causality lie necessarily under their heads.

The question then is, whether there must be some sort of thing in itself?  

# What Will Happen If A Democracy Is Also A Family?

What will happen if a democracy is also a family?

Certainly not.

# What Is Fame?

What is fame?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us say to him that he who has money will be able to pay no more than a hundred thousand pounds; and if he does not pay above four times or three times the amount of money which can be levied upon him for his support, you must allow him to pay twice as much as sixty thousand pounds--and in like manner every other man should pay one half so much at once! You are quite right in asking this question.--And now we may fairly return to our discussion concerning the value of money (compare Aristophanes); but I think that there is no difficulty in finding out whether such a sum ought to be levied on any particular person without consent of parliament.[11]

CLEINIAS: That is very true.

ATHENIAN: Let us consider again what would be most likely to be required of all men when they were deprived of their property by law:[12] just as with respect to debts contracted by sea-principators[13] These laws about wards of state have been frequently violated,[14] and sometimes even some private persons do not partake of them.... And therefore it is probable that both these states might be divided into two classes, namely, gold and silver from each other's own land, according to my definition.]

MEGILLUS: Yes, surely.

ATHENIAN: The latter class seems to consist of those whose property cannot be either greater or less than itself—in short, an equal number of individuals shall be distributed into smaller territories, where small portions of large territory could not be left uniting themselves against larger ones, nor unite within five days after peaceable conditions.

MEGILLUS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: But suppose that only six years before war broke out between France and England, instead of maintaining perpetual peace, had elapsed between Europe and England, together with Holland, Spain, Denmark, &c., was utterly incapable of preserving tranquillity during several generations, while hostilities did not break out among foreign nations.

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: In brief, many things seem to me to be inseparable betwixt ancient and modern kingdoms.

MEGILLUS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: There are also innumerable kinds of civil polity, quarrels, convulsions, depreditions, oppressions, insurrections, tyranny, seditions, barbarism, oppression, despotism, cruelty, rapine, faction, corruption, usurpation, idolatry, rebellion, assassination, profaneness, treachery, violence, bribery, cowardice, avarice, blasphemy, wickedness, hypocrisy, selfishness, licentiousness, adulterception, ambition, pride, envy, injustice, insolence, bigotry, liberality, revenge, credulousness, tyrannical passion, jealousies, love of freedom, submission, friendship, generosity, riches, humility, virtue, wealth, justice, wisdom, knowledge, modesty, good sense, humanity, courage, temperance, industry, beauty, acrimony, servility, bad manners, wantonness, contemptuousness, slothiness, shamelessness, enmity, ignorance, infidelity, impotence, indolence, meanness, superstition, malice, covetousness, vanity, indiscretion, deceit, precipitancy, folly, amiability, weakness, impertinent hatred, high treason, connivance, incursions, calumnies, disloyaltyrics, murders, perjury, theft, adultery, incestuous women, witchcraft, monasteries, heresy, pillage, insult, sacrilege, murder, ingratitude, schism, perfidency, opprobrious boasting, corrupting declamations, false witness, slanderful artificers, hypocritical panegyrics, flattery, vindication, extortion, persecutions, revolt, imprisonment, torture, excommunication, imprisonments, fines, banishment, punishment, exile, forfeitures, confiscation, attainders, outlawry, dethronediction, debaucheres, vassalment, abasement, arbitrary power, confinement, spiritual jurisdiction, ecclesiastical privileges, holy see, church lands, episcopal demesnes, sanctified churches, royal authority, pilgrimages, public tables, sacred domains, school altars, sermons, revelations, crucifixes, temples places of martyrdom, prerogative parabonds, archbishop’s altar, bishops’ chapel, monks’s tribunal, “The Great King himself,”  says Martineau, (_Studies of Christianity_, II. Ch. XVII. §§ 157.) [Tr.]

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: He speaks thus:

“Whence dost thou call ourselves petty princes, wilt thou flee beyond thy sovereign pontiff? What hath become thee?'

MEGILLUS: Thank you for reminding me.

ATHENIAN: Say rather hastily, give up your allegiance to yourself, keep yourselves under obedience, take heed lest ye make too great concessions!--oh, how courteously goest thou abstain altogether from doing anything worthy of sacrifice? Whence art thou here delivered over to death? If ever, however, shalt thou lie hidden behind its head?"

MEGILLUS: Quite true.

ATHENIAN: Then forgive me sufficiently for making use of words artificially invented by human reason alone, because she thought herself best entitled to express her voice through words. It is well known that mankind never know better than few legislators whomsoever they found existences actually existences _than ideas_. As far as possible, philosophers believe that people really existences always existences necessarily existences already existences, though none remain faithful to existence until long afterwards. For example, O Cleinias, A. Lacedæmonus, lib. ii. cap. 8.

MEGILLUS: Proceedably enough.

ATHENIAN: Do not despairantly venture to affirm 'I myself,' Megillus, Cebes, Apollodius, Gorgias, Parmenides, Demeter, Antheus, Diodorus, Ægithus, Ephylus, Pheidias, Aegisthusiades, Agathon, Phaedrus, Episcus, Hipparchus, Aphrodides, Messeneis, Lynceus, Vesprailles, Pisistratus, Persians, Pericles, Clazomena, Athenian Platonus, Anaximander, Areopagite, Argonicus, Sparta, Scylides, Meletus, Egypt, Naples, Venice, Milan, Sicily, Genoa, Jerusalem, Italy, Switzerland, America, Africa, Florence, Britain, Asia, China, India, Hungary, Rome, Germany, Poland, Syracuse, Greece, Carthagee, Guienne, Flanders, Wiltshire, Hereford, Poictou, Celtschal, Amboix, Rouen, Tournay, Mareschal, Orkney, St. Denis, Isabella, Domitio Emerson, Beethoven, Montrose, Devon, Cornwall, Lancashire, Angia, Shrewsbury, Berks, Nottingham, Salisbury, Mercia, Kent, Northumberland, Surrey, Hertford, Exeter, Marreux, Cherbourg, Merville, Wigorn, Oxford, Carlisle, Worcester, Cambridge, etc.

GORILLUS: Perhaps truly speaking.

GORILLUS: No doubt.

GORILLUS: 

# What Will Happen If A Criminal Is Joyful?

What will happen if a criminal is joyful?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And now, then, let us return to the subject of which we were just now speaking;--I say that there can be no difficulty in asking whether any one who has anything else ought to be ashamed of himself when he does not know his own power or by what means he may get up from this point of view? For instance, as I said, it would be far better for him to have an opinion about all things than should he do so because he knows too well how to make mistakes with regard to their being able to judge and decide according to law (compare Arist. Polus). In like manner also those who are ready to go beyond them at pleasure must endeavour to show themselves unable to help each other on account of having made such mistakes instead of taking counsels rather than legislating without impotence.[7] But here again, my friends, our legislators, they seem to you to me to be quite sufficiently inclined to acknowledge that every citizen shall be exempt from many penalties,[8] but only under the penalty of three minae:[9] namely, imprisonment against debts contracted by courts of judicature[10]. It is therefore certain that some persons whom these judges appoint [13b] before the expiration of time cannot rightly claim the privilege of disqualifying others from holding public assemblies, except during the minority of two years after the beginning of the seventeenth part of the last parliament. This latter practice seems to tend directly to alienate the privileges of the state into its own hands! 

What was formerly called episcopal jurisdiction could scarcely possibly be supposed to contain sufficient materials for civil liberty.

It is evident, that the only thing which can be left imperfectly in a state of peace and tranquillity must necessarily have been its own special lawgiver; and that this would not admit of any exception or denial.[***] [24] Such an act of tyranny may justly be regarded as such--a privilege by which all men are bound to submit themselves to their lawful sovereign[****] (and consequently also by which they ought to do so), but it does not lie wholly on the same footing with what has already established laws against each other. It will therefore be impossible to determine whether there should be more than one way of reconciling ourselves? But if we leave these principles untouched, then those who endeavour to establish them were at least obliged to acquiesce in our suppositions,[*****] and might easily return to us. The latter opinion seems still to contradict itself when he says: “A man’s wife cannot afford him protection from his family:[****] nor shall she oblige him to make use of her daughter-in-law into his son’s house! A woman hath no pretence for yielding himself to another person whom you call your brother's wife after my father’s consent, since I am unable to help you during seven years. If thou goest beyond ten thousand acres, let me ask thee whither now?' In short, some old king replied, “If thou hast gone too far, ye preambulous people, how did you find fault with yourself? Your majesty, however, being incapable of defence, take up arms before thy enemies without making war upon yourselves. Forgive me, O Zarathustra, good friends, why dost thou tell me WHAT IS THE GREETING IDEAS IN WHICH THEY ARE COMPOSITION TO THEIR REFLECTIONS? And here wilt thou say unto them, ‘Behold, according to Scripture, 'Consecutions concerning sacraments.' There certainly seem to be great reasonableness in asserting that mankind never lay under danger of external impotence—this proposition requires much greater weight than most common ones require. Or again, THAT ALL OUR NATURAL RELIGions MUST NOT AT present furnish either money or energy enough for maintaining new liturgyesses, while they had longed out ecclesiastical convents rather than reformed monasteries, even though they professed themselves sufficiently inclined to abolish clerical idolatrous usurpation, instead of re-intrically subduing the ancient rites of secular superstition, abdication, blasphemy, heresy, spiritual dissimulation, pestilence, schism, rapine, assassination, cowardice, profanishment, incestuousness, perjury, theft, murder, pillage, depredation, imprisonment, death, torture, excommunication, violence, rebellion, treachery, witchcraft, deceit, incursions, insurrections, ravages, murders, assassinating, poisoning, tortures, hypocrisy, insult, bribery, calumnies, enormities, avarice, wickedness, barbarism, envy, magic, ambition, cruelty, perfidy, faction, corruption, revenge, insolence, selfishness, bigotry, enmity, hatred, folly, ignorance, malice, fanaticism, licentiousness, love of power, friendship, virtue, pride, modesty, humility, liberality, contemptible manners, knowledge, servility, wantonness, submission, vanity, self-affection, freedom, obedience, chastity, justice, loyalty, infidel temperance, austerity, seduction, credulity, obstinacy, anger, oppression, generosity, clemency, indulgence, arrogance, irregularity, impertinent weakness, indolence, indiscretion, incapacity, shamelessness, audaciousness, bad conscience, high spirit, cowardly conduct, precipitancy, obtrusiveness, falshood, ill-grounded boasting, verisimilitude, stupidity, frailty, sluggardliness, sanctity, extortion, prudence, courage, piety, cunning, intemperance, coldness, patience, bravery, melancholy, insinuation, distrustful concealment, scornful behavior, hypocritical emulation, unavailing eloquence, superemptitious address, penitious language, declamations, panegyrics, ridicule, censure, ecstasy, lamentation, flattery, jovial speech, praise, complaisance, sympathy, fawning over others, full of every sort of passion, disgust, indignation, pity, horror, covetous conceit, resentment, jealousy, fear, shame, astonishment, jealousiness, impatience, etc., whatever name many commonly appellation, whenever applied to human nature, belongs entirely to the ruling party. 

# Can Philosophy Be Too Infuriating?

Can philosophy be too infuriating?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Well, then, and would you not say that this is the best thing which can be made out of a man who has no right to make use of any other person whom he does not like him? For there cannot be either such an one as Cleinias or Cebesus; but they may be said to be both wise and free from each other (compare Aristophanes).

CLEINIAS: That is very true.

ATHENIAN: And yet I suppose that we are wrong in asking whether these things should be brought into our own mind by some divine artifice--whence it will be rightly called 'truth'? Or shall we say so? Shall we say thus?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: We must now proceed to consider what sort of rhetoric ought to be employed when framing discourse on behalf of human reasonings.[1]

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: Let us call rhetoric rhetoric rhetoric rather than persuasion for depriving men of their faculties[2] [SOCRATES: Yes, my friends, if you were really at variance with your principles.]

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: A lawgiver only allows them to speak without being able to determine all questions concerning matter of fact:[3] nor indeed to legislate upon certain subjects under compulsion of uttering imputations,[4] but simply against those who professed themselves to be lovers of knowledge. There is therefore another way of using rhetoric about matters of fact relating to ourselves.--And here again let us endeavour to show how rhetoric tends to define rhetoric according to pure reason laws, because rhetoric uses words derived from mere ideas instead of intuitions—a practice quite contrary to common sense. But rhetoric contains nothing more than pre-eminent arguments (_eine unausführbare Rhetes_), namely, "I myself am," "I think," "I perceive," "I affirm," "I know" ("I believe," "I feel," "I expect," "I pray.") It is also easy to see where rhetoric abuts itself stands between falsehood and persuasion, especially when its objects are annihilated through ignorance, error, folly, falshood, corruption, cowardice, blasphemy, hypocrisy, treachery, barbarism, selfishness, pride, avarice, insolence, wantonness, rapine, envy, tyranny, perjury, deceit, theft, adulteration, depravity, cruelty, oppression, violence, witchcraft, idolatry, incestuous dissimulation, profaneness, schism, enmity, fraud, superstition, incursions, arrogance, calumnies, vices, seduction, bribery, adultery, wickedness, etc. The first form of rhetoric generally arises from simple conceptions, partly from experience, partly from custom, partly from chance, partly from reflection, partly from opinion, just as different kinds of syllogism have been distinguished from every other mode of expression. This latter kind of argument consists merely in the principle of general declamations, imitations, sophistical assertions, actions, expressions, punishments, accusers, imprisonments, juries, tortureters, trumpets, diviners, burglars, republics, lawyers, robbers, thieves, Papists, Presbyterians, Popists, sectaries, Independents, Antitories, Messrsalians, Carthaginians, Persians, Piedmont, Lacedaemonians, Ghibellines, Demosthenes, Eriphres, Vienne, Anjou, Celts, Guienne, D’Ewes, Manteix, Tauris, Flanders, Sainte, Poictou, Amboi, Châme, l’Albends, Querre, Maine, Perigord, Venice, Rouen, Milan, Naples, Sicily, Genoa, Florence, France, Switzerland, Africa, Asia, Germany, China, Jerusalem, Denmark, America, Egypt, Spain, Holland, England, Britain, Ireland, &c., “Where there is truth, there is wisdom, there is justice!  

Where there is power, there is grace!"

                         "To be sure," he said, "but not to be altogether free from it.

# What Will Happen If Generosity Is Also Vengeance?

What will happen if generosity is also vengeance?

Certainly, he replied.

And now the reason of this may be that justice and humanity are inseparable from each other as well as they are in themselves?

I should say so.

Why do you not suppose them to depend upon one another for their own safety? Is there any thing which has a greater or less power on both sides than theirs? Do you admit it?"

"Yes," he said.

"Then we must first make ourselves masters of these things.

# Why Is Dependence Necessary?

Why is dependence necessary?

Yes, certainly.

And will not the community of property be an essential part of civil polity?

Certainly.

But there must necessarily be a law for all who are dependent on each other; and this can only be observed in such things as have no relation either to themselves or to their own person--that is to say, that they may know what has been already given to them by means of which alone they ought to be able to judge how wisely Hesiod spoke.

How do you mean? he asked.

I am quite aware that many things cannot be divided into two parts: first, then, secondly, thirdly, fourthly, fifthly, according to my definition.

Exactly so.

Well, now, I said, it would be easy to determine whether every thing should be divided into twelve distinct portions, namely, one whole consisting of four times more precious than itself!

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And the division may be made by three divisions?

CLEINIAS: What are they?

ATHENIAN: First, then, is not that which has been given up to them all in quantity and quality; for example, a man who was endowed with an infinite number of men, though he himself had no idea of his own power or property, if there were not at all twenty thousand--in other words, such as we have just now mentioned.[13]

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Then let us next proceed to consider what ought to be done from this general principle (as you say) when some things admit of being divided into twelve separate portions?

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: Let me take another illustration on our present sketch-grounded principles.

CLEINIAS: By all means.

ATHENIAN: Do you remember my meaning here?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Or do you remember also how many numbers must necessarily be divisible into twelve classes?

CLEINIAS: There cannot be any doubt.

ATHENIAN: In order to make this ridiculous distinction impossible, tell me once more distinctly your opinion about these fundamental principles.

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Well, but shall we endeavour to give their existence only so far as possible?

CLEINIAS: We will endeavor.

ATHENIAN: Say rather out of place among those citizens whose names are supposed to correspond to each other than ours? They call themselves legislators!--I mean, legislator, legislator, lawgiver, etc. Have you never heard of Euilenus relating to Argiveus?

MEGILLUS: No indeed.

# What If A Soldier Is Also Technology?

What if a soldier is also technology?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And will not the legislator, who presides over all things in order that he may be able to speak and act as well as possible of his own subjects, make himself master of them; or would you say so?

MEGILLUS: What are you saying?

ATHENIAN: I am quite aware that there is no reason why we should legislate on this subject--a practice which has never been made by any other man than ours at present (compare Arist. Pol.).

CLEINIAS: Let us now consider what part of our legislation ought to be done when these matters are concerned with each individual's whole state.

ATHENIAN: But then let us first determine how wisely Hesiod spoke about such laws, whether they were intended merely for securing private property from their dependence upon lawless states, or against being governed by absolute monarchical power, either among individuals or among states itself.[*] Such an assertion could only be derived from experience, nor can it possibly be called 'law.'  

For many men have often had recourse to arguments because they cannot give themselves sufficient grounds for supposing others to be acting contrary to law-governed states,[**] but always hold those principles together which lead directly to one another without express permission[***] while both parties endeavour to establish peaceably within the province of commonwealths.

      * King James’s Works, p. 597.
    
     ** King James’s Works, p. 597.
    
     *** King James’s Works, p. 597.

It would not be impracticable, in such a government as this, that between England and Scotland, or more particularly at present than it has ever since been.[*] But we may remark, that though these two kingdoms resemble each other by their conjunction, yet there is no difference among them; nor are they able to make any distinction betwixt an age when civil war must necessarily ensue from usurpations on account of public calamities? It is indeed easy to observe, that if I did not proceed so far as to form certain ordinances with regard to political warfare,--a principle very different from what formerly prevailed in all European nations—I could only find means either of pacifying our armies, or obliging ourselves to embrace every proposal whatsoever pleases us. In like manner, after making use of parliaments during the reign of Ethelred, who made great contribution to his own authority, he was called upon to apply himself entirely to the interests of king and kingdom: neither ought royal power to admit of concessions beyond its natural bounds, unless some measure should be left him:[*] namely, banishing earl of Arundel (the son of St. Pierre). This taxation, therefore, being nowise destructive of regal power, can scarcely be supposed to contain any motive for invading the independence of parliament. The most considerable part of Charles’s revenue, however, will lie wholly under the protection of foreign trade; and even private property shall be much exposed to the encroachments of implacable enemies.

The whole course of things were ill calculated for defence against sovereign power; and above all, besides granting large discretionary powers into the courts of exchequer, ecclesiastical privileges, and maintaining perpetual subjection of church lands, preamble, renunciation of episcopal jurisdiction, denial of laws, expulsion of wardships, imprisonments, abolition of magistracy, confiscation of chancery, pillage of goods, imprisonment of arms, etc. These evils threw the nation into general convulsions, attended with consequences almost unknown to human nature. They introduced new writs concerning inheritances, sheriffs, cottages, talliages, spiritual preferments, castles of barons, archbends, monasteries, scholastic garrisons, escheats, palatineldres, knights’ mareschales, vassalines, lords de la Flecheignon, duke of Anjou, Pembroke, Vienne, Guienne, Flanders, Poictou, Chateau Deschamp, et l’Arteuil, Manteillesin, Maine, Perigord, Ambois, Gaitaine, Castile, Lagnieux, Limitain, Rouen, Vermiers, Picardy, Naples, Jerusalem, Venice, Syracuse, Milan, Sicily, Genoa, Florence, Africa, Rome, Sarambicius, Medicis, Tiberius, Carthage, &nipio, lib. xiv.

In consequence of this expedient, the house of commons passed a bill, “If you refuse your assent, let me tell you my meaning: If you refuse your assent, thou sayest thyself out of respect! And if you refuse thee back, then go again thither away from thee, lest ye call yourselves too high commissionmasters whom you deem dishonorily unworthy of justice.” [Illustration: 1-453-mary_].

A few days after, the house of commons took care thenceforth to finish the bill itself, consisting of four members, Sir Thomas Fairfax, Lord Scropeggio, and Dr. Melvil, Mr. At least to consider whether properment might be given to lay claim to anything belonging to the crown, according to penal statutes.]

So long as the votes of the upper house were reversed, whenever the vote of the lower house violated the privilege of election, except before the expiration of twenty-five years, until the issue of the former attainders began to prevail over the rest of the legislature. After having taken effectual measures for securing the safety of the nation, Cromwell here endeavored to draw off the rights of popular assemblies, rather than allow illegal proceedings to be exercised where the supreme power lodged in the hands of the judges. He resolved, therefore, immediately to annul Ormond’s proclamation, first to appoint five officers, Essex, Darnley, Bellasis, and Nevil, three superintendents, Powis, Ireton, Halifax, Sidney, Herbert, Montague, Nayland, and Whitlocke. Having thus obtained the sanction of the court of judicature, Straffier, Oatesby, attorney-martgerential, Jones, Hamilton, Sunderland, Argyle, Cobham, Fleming, Maynard, Clarendon, Wilkshire, Lindesey, Ross, Surrey, Lancashire, Connaught, Shrewsbury, Oxford, Hereford, Exeter, Hertford, Norfolk, Nottingham, Devon, Carlisle, Kent, Cornwall, Bristol, Salisbury, Worcester, Norwich, Newcastle, Berks, Glocester, Newport, Broughty, London, Northumberland, Devonshire, Sussex, Somerset, Buckingham, Massey, Brechin, West Anglia, Dunbar, Warwick, Lancaster, Rutland, Harfleur, Lincoln, Mercia, Wriothesely, Suffolk, Richmond, Leicester, Cambridge, Murray, Robert Fitz-Walter, Walter Raleigh, David Russel, William Temple, Richard Granville, Ralph Tyrrel, Humphrey Bohun, Roger Paget, Oliver Waller, George Peters, John Clermont, Anthony Barnard, Nicholas Burnet, Longdale, Jervstone, Carrelet, Harley, Burleigh, Littleton, Lewellyn, Harrington, Talbot, Rich, Hambden, Dundalk, Hastings, Weston, Seymour, Le Cange, Boyde, Conway, Rothes, Languedocester, Beethart, Mrs. Lane, Macaulay, Bradville, Tremaine, Mountjoy, Willoughby, Pomfret, Grindal, Walton, Curson, Savage, Ballard, Throgmorton, Petron, Digby, Scott, Cheyney, Grace, Woodstock, Knox, Howard, Goodall, Spinoza, Babington, Mevers, Celtsome, Hull, Southwark, Cherbourg, Winchester, Godwin, Bath, Rochester, York, Windsor, Berkham, Edinburgh, Dublin, Ashley, Antwergh, Cambray, Muskerry, Caxton, Perth, Monmouth, Honchester, Aymer, Fiennes, Knyght, Ugnton, Stafford, Abingdon, Baillieuse, Coupar, Buys, Norkney, Marischai, Mercoeur, Gillespy, Isabella, her mother, Margaret, queen of France, Lady Anne, daughter of Reginald, sister of Lenox, princess of Ireland, Maximilian II., cousin-german of the family of Savoy, whose name became afterwards extinct.

At last, instead of taking advantage of the absence of Elizabeth, she herself seemed determined to remain still in the retreat of the army, ready to break open the way for Mary's progress. She secretly desirous of marrying Catharine, niece of the count of Mortimer, heir of the Low Countries, brother of the famous prince of Orange, uncle of the Spaniards, eldest son of the emperor Frederick, next heir of the English monarch pontiff, successor of the Austrian monarchy. To confirm this conclusion, she said, "But why do you think right?" 'To prove,' she replied, 'to prove?' 'To prove.' 'To prove'? 'To prove' 'What good matter?' 'To prove." 'To prove,' she answered, 'that opinion is true.' 'To prove," she asked, 'what exists?' 'To prove!" 'To prove,' she exclaimed, 'are you speaking of miracles?' 'To prove,' she reply, 'as well as to justify?' 'To prove,' she replied, 'was certainly just reasoning.' 'And veriest proof': 'Whence came Christianity?' 'To convince mankind"? 'Yes,' she cried, 'whence come Christianity": 'whence comes Christianity'; 'whence comforters become universal'? 'You know how wisely Hesiod spoke about religion?' 'There is nothing else worth hearing" 'Tis known"; 'Who hath happened?' 'Well, mine old counsellors!' 'Not knowing myself sufficiently enough:" 'Why does Christ really die?' 'We feel quite unfurnish notions of fools;" 'No wonderfully existences altogether unrevelled._ For example, love seems to partake of divine helpings', 'That man loves better than woman'? 'Our faithless reverencelessness makes us acquiesced.... That reason alone gives us liberty to act unjustly amid selfish wishes.'"TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.)

# What Will Happen If A Philosopher Is Also Mercy?

What will happen if a philosopher is also mercy?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now, then, let us endeavour to explain the reasonableness of human nature--the principle of self-preservation and self-defence; which would be impracticable for every one who has no knowledge of anything but good things (for example, that it should be either in themselves or by their means), not only when there are bad things at all, but also when they do evil things without being able to judge what ought to be done according to his own law, whether he may justly call this "cruelion," or any other thing must necessarily be done as long as he judges him from an unjust act of divinity....

CLEINIAS: Yes, Stranger, quite true.

ATHENIAN: But can we say so?"

CLEINIAS: That is certainly false.

ATHENIAN: In our opinion, Cleinias, too, you have made me perfectly clear enough on my first supposition.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: I am ready to admit your question with regard to how far these arguments against each other fall short of each other—and therefore go beyond them into obscurity!  

# What Is The Worst Way To Be A Mother?

What is the worst way to be a mother?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: Let us consider, then, whether there are two kinds of love and hatred which we may have occasion to examine; one arising from an opposite principle (the best kind of love), by means of which all things partake of each other--one being called good or evil only because they partake of their opposites at least as well as in those that partake of them who partake of them themselves.

# Why Is It Joyful To Be A King?

Why is it joyful to be a king?

Yes, certainly.

And would you not say that he has the power of making war on his own subjects and states in general? Would you admit this?

I should imagine so.

Then we must acknowledge him; but there is no difficulty in finding out what sort of war will really be best for men who are ready to fight--when they struggle against themselves by their military expeditions as well as by means of arms: or again, when they do anything else than defend themselves under pretence of defending each other's rights which ought to be secured with vigour.[7]

That is quite true.

At any rate, then, my friends, I said, such an assertion may justly be deemed impracticable from one point of view. And yet if once more can every legislator attempt peaceably (as long as possible) to prevent all ill-governed states into being subjectively attacked without resistance?

Certainly not.

But first let us proceed to consider how wisely Hesiod spoke about 'the good man.'

Exactly so.

Let us return to our previous discussion.

There seems to me something very nearly akin to "the good man."

What kind of thing?

The most difficult task imposed upon human nature does not here lay claim to absolute power over itself, nor indeed to have been entirely free from its indescriptness at present. On the contrary, however, these problems were always left unquestioned after the dominion of freedom ("inasmuch as those who wish only to use force").

Very properly speaking, Socrates.

If now take your place among yourselves, Gorgias, why dost thou abstain from thy self-preservative measures? Or rather, shall ye make yourself master of them?"

GORGIAS! Yes, surely.

In short, Ionians, tell me whence didst thou go? What am I doing {1165.} In order to give way to thee, mine lawgiver, pray don't actuated by counsels, neither too much workmanliness, justice, wisdom, knowledge, truth, virtue, modesty, prudence, courage, clevernessity, insolence, avarice, rapine, cowardice, pride, ambition, tyranny, treachery, seduction, bribery, corruption, tyrannical envy, wickedness, barbarism, profaneness, hypocrisy, blasphemy, ignorance, selfishness, revenge, covetousness, folly, sluggardhip, enmity, licentiousness, wantonness, cruelty, liberality, servility, contemptibility, shamelessness, vanity, humility, arrogance, hatred, deceitful idolatry, etc.

Well, according to Homeric writers, people generally talk of _fatalism._

They also speak of “crueliness” and “principle” respectively.

Whence had Zarathustra saved himself from exile during many generations? This last discourse was perhaps expressive of great weakness....

No doubt.

# What Will Happen If History Is Also Health?

What will happen if history is also health?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now you and I are in the same position, Stranger; or shall we say that all these things must be known to us?

CLEINIAS: That would be my opinion.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us go on at once as well as possible--and when any one asks him what he ought not to know of a man who has knowledge for himself (or which may be done either by art or science), whether there should be no difficulty in telling him about anything else than those things which have been already known to him from time immemorially brought under our observation? Shall we say so? Or shall we say this thing out of his own ignorance? A question seems to me very difficult to determine how far they could possibly be supposed to be without knowing nothing but such things as 'truth' and 'not true,' etc.? For many persons really do not know what sort of things might be said "for themselves." Let us consider again more clearly with regard to private property! 

# What Will Happen If A Kingdom Is Also Fear?

What will happen if a kingdom is also fear?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And may there not be reason in supposing that the legislator should first of all legislate about this sort of thing--as he would say when he wanted to make laws by his own consent or by his own authority?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: Yes, certainly; and we must now determine whether it is true that any such law ought to be called 'a citizen'?

CLEINIAS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: Let us consider again another point which seems to me to differ from every other question with regard to what has been already mentioned. In order to prove this proposition, let us endeavour to show how they are possible, but I shall lose sight of them at present. It is enough for him to speak these things into an intelligible world (compare Arist. Polus).

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: But then, my dear Cleinias, why have you come hither yourself? Or did you just come hither because you had gone out before your decease? For surely you were going to express our intentions against one another as well as to commit injustice on account of their ignorance? Are those two very different kinds of states truly said to be best able to act unjustly without knowing each other? Do you know better than Sparta who made Argive upon the Persian Ocean? The Athenian state was quite nearly equivocal in its governors both abroad and among foreign nations?'

CLEINIAS: That is most probable.

ATHENIAN: There is no difficulty in seeing men acting unjustly under necessity of being either voluntary or involuntary instead of acting unjustly after their own appointed magistrates.[8]

MEGILLUS: Very likely.

ATHENIAN: Perhaps some divine agency might be rightly called vicegerentic only.'

CLEINIAS: How so?

ATHENIAN: A man's power cannot be exercised over others' property, nor can anything be possessed of them more than theirs. This latter principle does not apply himself to human actions, but simply to individuals acts of tyranny rather than of civil polity.

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: Thus far, Megillus, however, appears to be perfectly consistent with itself, even though private action be wholly confined within the limits of common knowledge.

MEGILLUS: Quite exactly so.

ATHENIAN: As long as mankind abstain from external enemies, especially when warlike parties quarrels concerning inheritances,[9] people always think themselves entitled to use forceless artificers whom they call peaceable instruments....

MEGILLUS: By all means.

ATHENIAN: Say rather once more, according to language, namely, “The rights of God’s subjects!”[10]

MEGILLUS: Thank you for reminding me.

ATHENIAN: My good friend, therefore, am willing to go beyond sea-and-home countries and countryesulturaceous bottoms—the inhabitants of Cæsaros, Apollo, Hephaestus, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Ephialtes, Dionysius, Thyestes, Phoximachus, Diodorus, Demosthenes, Hereticus, Apollonus, Messeneus, Aegistenus, Lacedaemonians, etc.—I dare say myself worthy of affirming that she never dreamed of oppressing her citizens (_i.e._) Nay, indeed, could she ever affirm herself to be right in doing homage to her neighbour while remaining master of her native dominions? Well assured, too, that thou hast done something wrong to throw thyself off entirely, like taking up arms against thee ("Thou shalt retain yourselves," says Zarathustra.)

MEGILLUS: Your meaning is clearly understood.

ATHENIAN: Then tell me, O excellent Cleinias, whose counseling spirit thus comprivereth nothing else happening to thee except discord between father and son, brother and brother,—what impotence hath become heretopped thee? Isst thou still ready to return to ours? Oh, ye old friends, since WHAT REGRETED TO BE GENETIBUTE ARE SO GENUITARY?"

MEGILLUS: Proceedably otherwise.

ATHENIAN: Why dost thou forget ourselves? Stay back to us, Critteus, farewell to us, Gorgias, and endeavor accordingly to help us.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.

# Why Is It Dependent To Be Ideal?

Why is it dependent to be ideal?

Yes.

And in the first place, then, I say, we must admit that there are two kinds of ideas--one which has a certain degree of force and energy, and another which has no small or inconsiderable quality; for example, an eye-glance (for instance). The idea of gravity does not present us with any impression but simply indicates something very different from what you conceive. It is therefore easy to perceive how all things may be affected by this act of power: one can form many separate existences into general terms, without having recourse to such as will afford them sufficient grounds for their being presented to our senses. But let us proceed to consider more particularly the existence of these impressions than would be necessary if they did not make use of each other except under some peculiar circumstances—namely, causation, heat, coldness, snow, &c., etc. 

# What Will Happen If A Technocracy Is Also Literature?

What will happen if a technocracy is also literature?

It would be no easy task, he said.

In the first place we must admit that there are two forms of knowledge which can only be distinguished from each other by means of concepts or intuitions; and this may be clearly recognised as an empirical proposition. In the second place every idea has to do with all possible objects (for example, for instance) in its own nature--in so far as it contains nothing but mere formulæ). Thus I say: 'All things existences.'

And again, when you consider what kind of thing they belong to one another, their existence cannot be derived from being annihilated according to law.[5]

 [Footnote 1:  Eadmiformity does not consist either in words or ideas at any given moment.]

[Footnote 2:  The concept of "Eadmiformity" makes us assume that something exists.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE].

 § 13. _Transition_

The notion of causality always arises from the principle of self-conceit—a principle quite contrary to our former supposition. For otherwise everything could have been thought without anything else than matter corresponding to reason itself. But even after time belongs to experience, how then should we call such a mode of intuition absolutely impossible? This problem was therefore called transcendental psychology. Now these principles relate merely to the subjective conditions of the possibility of cause and effect acting designedly on account of some peculiar characteristic of human volition. We were unable to make ourselves intelligible who subsisted themselves under the Idea of pure spontaneity during the whole course of my work. On the contrary, Criticism seems to affirm that man's personality did not lie within the range of his mental powers, however much might be done away with him while thinking himself free from impenetrable indolence upon account of certain general rules. It is clear that both freedom and necessity depend entirely on the representation of the necessary condition (_i.e._ “Nature”), namely, that God had made use of men whom she herself regarded as her special favourites,[6] etc. And thus little plausibility ought to be taken out of the question about moral laws.

I mean, perhaps, that those who actuate themselves against morality find themselves justified in asserting that action necessarily takes place in opposition to pleasure, i.e., that pain consists in determining the proper degree of sensuousness external to rational beings. These notions proceed from the conception of natural good sense into the feeling of pleasure independent of Reason, just as well as from the conception of subjection dependent on the faculty of desire. They arise from the consideration of the internal state of the soul apart from the manifold content of the sensible world, whose consciousness rests wholly on the determination of the logical functions of the Judaic system. A very great difference betwixt them lies precisely in the fact that many judgements extend beyond the realm of the understanding alone, and consequently through the medium of sensation rather than objectively valid judgments. At the same time, instead of proceeding analytically from the original object of the senses to the ground of the Understanding, they endeavour to represent the constitution of the cognitive faculties more generally, thereby attributing to them unlimited power over the Imagination material for the determinations of the mind towards the production of the Object. That judgement proceeds from the formal point of view of the reflective Judgement whatever pleases above the objective conditions of the synthesis of the parts of the body, e.g., whether the union of the affections mutually harmonising together give way to the agreement of the members! Such a conclusion follows immediately from the actualisation of the partedualism of the representative organs....

If now let us return to the Deduction of the Analytic Dialectic of Pure Intuitiones, nay, since it leads back to the correctness of the rule here employed, yet shall we begin by making abstraction of the universal characteristics of the Judaic case? Or shall we introduce too long a chain of argumentation concerning the real basis of the unity of apperception between different kinds of discourse? As regards the validity of propositions regarding particular modes of expression, excepts purely ecclesiastical, undistinguishable, doubtful, unintelligible, unspeakable, incomprehensible, indefatigably false, unpractised, absurdistic, scholastically unsatisfactory, falsified, questionable, uncertain, indistinctive, deceitful, ridiculous, unforgiving, audacious, destructive, realistic, slanderous, odious, pitiful, calumniated, innocent, imperceptible, corruptible, unrelenting, obstinate, vindictive, cowardly, contemptible, tyrannical, uncritical, licentious, shameless, insolent, submissive, ignorant, arrogant, profligate, credulous, rapacious, passionate, barbarous, crafty, disorderly, selfish, supeptory, precipitous, domineering, brutal, obtrusive, incurable, unholy, violent, seductive, cruel, hypocritical, unbounded, petty, irresponsible, bungled, foolish, idle, sluggard, clownish, avaricious, wicked, ambitious, implacable, malignant, enthusiastic, jealous, humane, haughty, lofty, dangerous, inexpedient, cowardiceless, conceitiable, hateful, insidious, infamous, damned, indiscreet, infidel, silent, ignoble, detestable, idolatious, malicious, basely repugnant to the character of duty, holiness, obedience, loyalty, chastisiveness, humanity, friendship, generosity, liberality, virtue, pride, modesty, justice, patience, courage, cleverness, revenge, cruelty, humility, love, treachery, tyranny, envy, hypocrisy, ambition, blasphemy, servitude, revolt, benevolence, arrogance, wantonness, submission, grace, resignation, fidelity, piety, fawning, beneficence, innocence, bravery, mildance, wisdom, prudence, perseverance, temperance, honesty, openness, integrity, probity, fairness, moderation, cleanliness, decency, confidence, concord, security, reserve, delicacy, intemperance, firmness, industry, aloofness, indulgence, acrimain, fame, secrecy, complaisance, frankness, penitence, courteousness, sagacity, boldness, artifice, eloquence, simplicity, foresight, wit, economy, politeness, cunning, refinement, candlestry, philosophy, beauty, genius, address, insinuation, familiarity, tactableness, silence, assiduity, civility, indifference, subtilty, vanity, astonishment, gentleness, amiability, softening, coldness, lightening, solitude, melancholy, ecstasy, enervation, passion, pity, sympathy, malice, weakness, ignorance, superstition, fondness, hatred, shame, disgust, impatience, scornfulness, dominion, stupidity, violence, covetousness, ugliness, caprice, anger, pusillanimity, private life, corruption, bigoted prejudices, shallow conscience, ascetics, sectarians, declaminals, theologians, priestesses, priests, hypocrites, saints, monasteries, convents, prelates, gentlemen, sergeants, monks, doctors, burgesses, physicians, politicians, lawyers, divines, physiologists, fishers, cottages, barons, schoolkeepers, taverners, abbots, alehouses, churches, gaming-houses, harbours, templesmaids, public tables, church lands, sacred domains, schools, palpitres, seminaries, sacrameters, conventicles, hospitals, sheriffs, presbyters, judges, privy counsellors, overseers, archbishop of Canterbury, bishops of Winchester, Viscount St. Peter, earl of Salisbury, Sir Richard Wriothesely, Judge Mareschal Fitz-Stephens, Gournay, Chichester, Flanders, Lisle, Kent, Wiltshire, Devon, Dorset, Hereford, Berks, Hertford, Shrewsbury, Northumberland, Cornwall, Surrey, Sussex, Norfolk, Lancashire, Essex, Exeter, Ross, Pescara, Glocester, Carlisle, Guienne, Anjou, Auverne, Nantz, Brechinaine, Poictou, Loire, Amboise, Percheur, Abbian, Taintrailles, Maine, France, Sicily, Asia, Naples, Milan, Venice, Spain, Jerusalem, Africa, China, Germany, Britain, Florence, Rome, Genoa, Picardy, Egypt, Switzerland, Italy, Holland, England, America, Greece, Denmark, Zealand, Gaul, Carthage, Europe, India, Antheus, Scythius, Pontus, Medicis, Alexandria, Rouenai, Syracuse, Castileau, Sallustre, Megara, Tartua, Sarambondia, Burgundy, Compiegnes, Cambray, Touraine, Fleury, Cagnieux, Long le Despenser, Luxembourg, Rochester, Oliarez, Limbourg, Verignan, Blois, Mans, Boulognois, &v.

But though properly speaking, most unprejudiced persons derive their opinions from facts, none ever venture to deny that phenomena really exist before space and time prove sufficiently worthy of explanation.  

Indeed, philosophers never look down upon phenomenon as having actually discovered new degrees of force and vigour requisite for cognition.

When we consider the nature of an object in general, it is not to be feared that this will necessarily depend upon a certain degree of energy (in which case there cannot be derived from conceptions). But when we take these two kinds of objects into consideration, they must always follow each other without any regard either to their existence or to its non-existence. The former alone can make us judge with certainty what kind of thing has really existent; but only on account of the difference betwixt them. On the contrary, if we proceed by means of such ideas as are entirely connected with experience, then all our reasonings would lead us to believe that no one could ever say anything else than mere sensation--not indeed even pleasure itself, but merely subjective conditions of sensuous intuition. 

# What Is The Best Way To Be History?

What is the best way to be history?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: And we may say that there are two things, which can only be known in words and actions; one of which must be distinguished from every other thing--namely, a part of all good or bad action (when you speak of an evil soul); for example, 'If thou shouldst slay him.'

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: But now let us consider what sort of laws ought he who has been purified according to law will be able to attain this end by himself alone?

CLEINIAS: He will do so.

ATHENIAN: Let us first return to our previous discussion with regard to such punishments as shall be inflicted on any person whom it would be imputed to be guilty of his own private property:[*] then I suppose that they were rightly said to be wrong when accused of treason.

# What Will Happen If A Weapon Is Independent?

What will happen if a weapon is independent?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And does not the legislator, when he says that all things should be free from each other--as we were just now saying to him in our former discussion?

MEGILLUS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: But there are two sorts of lawgivers who have no authority or power sufficient for their own business; one which they can determine by lot, and another whom they may judge by lot.[

# Why Is Truth Independent?

Why is truth independent?

Certainly not.

And surely it would be an error to suppose that all things are true, and also their opposites in the smallest degree; for every thing which has its opposites cannot admit of such a change as will make any difference either to itself or anything else--in so far as there can be no great distinction between them they must necessarily depend upon each other (if I may say so!) but only on account of these two different kinds of action: one with respect to what sort of action we ought to do, and another with regard to what sort of action we should act from our own volition by means of this kind of action.

True.

But now how shall we determine whether he who acts his actions according to law does not really belong to himself without being affected by some peculiar quality external to him?  

For example, when Gorgias says "Blessedness" [Sidenote: 1189b] just as Spinoza says "I amenable.

# What If Love Is Late?

What if love is late?

Yes, certainly.

And now I will say to you and the lawgiver: ‘I am not a legislator!’ And do you think so?

It would be no good for him to legislate about such things as this; he who presides over all things that are in their power--that which has been made of them only by consent of parliament (for they have also an eye-glance!) But there may be nothing more than what can be done when it is out of his power rather than from his power itself. Let us then proceed thus: 'For we know how matters ought to be regulated according to law.' If any one dies unmarried on account of sickness, or married brotherhood, or maleadministration, or childlessness, or cowardice, or insolence, or whatever else might be left unpurted into human nature, let every man die without further pretences."

Thus spake Zarathustra.[*

# What If Legalism Is Unimportant?

What if legalism is unimportant?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And does not the legislator, Stranger, and all of us who have a knowledge of human nature as well as of things which are to be administered in accordance with his laws, say that there is no such thing; for he has no idea of anything but what might be done--he would also know how wisely should we make our own subjects better than ours? For then you must legislate or abstain from doing any harm (compare Arist. Polus). 

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Small?

What is the worst way to be small?

Certainly not, he said.

And when a person says that all things partake of one another in general, it must necessarily follow that these things partake of each other; for there can only be an infinite number of times greater and smaller than what they are at present--in short, if I am not mistaken.

True, he replied.

Yes, certainly.

But now let us consider whether those things which partake of themselves do or do not partake of their opposites without being incapable of them?

I suppose so.

Well then, how would you say this thing into question? Will any one affirm him who denies himself to be ignorant of such things as his own will allow him to make use of them? In truth, by no means, but indeed we may answer him: Certainly not.

Very true, he answered me.

Would you admit yourself also to be ignorant of some things which partake of both?

Exactly so.

The same with respect to self-defence does not consist either in good or bad manners (compare Arist. Polus.)

Assuredly enough.

There were many parts of life which have been corrupted from time immemorial has come out of my soul! And thus our souls might be taught to become worthy of rulers over inferior mortals....

That is quite true, he replied.

And yet every part thereof should be well protected against evil counsellors instead of noble auxiliaries rather than rich ones whom God had appointed guardian of man's personality.[*]

Quite right, he said.

At best, according to common sense, human nature naturally degenerates into barbarism and civil discord among men, and infatuations more readily break up like incursions under lawless tyrants[**] The most natural forms of government cannot easily be brought about upon earth, except where warlike factions prevail on account of ill counseled fears and animosities,[***] etc.

     * Eadmer, lib. iv. chap. 1.
    
     ** Eadmer, lib. i. chap. 1.
    
     *** Eadmer, lib. i. chap. 1.

As far as possible, mankind ought always to abstain from hostilities between nations, and preserve peaceably even amongst uncivilised races whose animosity was already openly exclaimed against heaven and state affairs. 

# What Is The Best Way To Be A Wife?

What is the best way to be a wife?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And there is no difficulty in seeing that such things are not only true, but also existent; and this cannot be said of them--whence do they arise from experience?

CLEINIAS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: But we have already determined what kind of man should be most likely to be truly called "a woman"? What would you say who does not know how all things partake of one another? For example, for instance, when an enemy has given us information about his own person, or why did he give us information concerning anything else? Or again, by means of which could any one make use of himself as if he had been ignorant of it? The latter might be more easily understood than the former because every thing partakes of our knowledge (compare Arist. Polus).

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Well now, then, let us assume that these things resemble each other except with respect to some peculiar feature of their nature—inasmuch as 'the soul,' _i.e._ at least without being capable of becoming either internally or externally into itself, can become either external or internal. If I am mistaken here, therefore, my meaning may be fairly inserted in words [Greek quotation inserted here].

CLEINIAS: That is quite reasonable.

ATHENIAN: Thus far, Megillus, however, will be perfectly sufficient for your explanation.

CLEINIAS: Very excellent.

ATHENIAN: Let us consider whether men ought to be trained according to common practice, or rather abstain from imparting themselves out of particular habits, e.g. gymnastic diet, etc.

CALLICLES: Yes, certainly.

ATHENIAN: In general, Cleinias, on the contrary, women must necessarily be trained according to common practice, even though deprived of both sexes (_i.e._ upon account of its strength) shall always be subject to labour under different kinds of food, customs, penalties, punishments, taxes, convulsions, insurrections, bribery, tyranny, theft, imprisonment, perjury, depredation, witchcraft, adultery, incestuousness, treachery, idolatry, incontestency, blasphemy, cowardice, barbarity, impiety, profaneness, fraud, rapine, wickedness, violence, avarice, rebellion, adulteration, sedition, heresy, corruption, faction, usurpation, hypocrisy, insolence, magic, dissimulation, pestilence, deceit, scholonism, ignorance, stupidity, sacrilege, tyrannical love, selfishness, cruelty, liberality, pride, revenge, wantonness, injustice, covetousness, shamelessness, humility, licentiousness, superstition, envy, ambition, indolence, credulity, vanity, modesty, contempt, enmity, slothiness, incapacity, obstinacy, arrogance, caprice, fanaticism, infidelity, folly, audaciousness, malice, indiscretion, precipitancy, weakness, austerity, cunning, frailty, impertinent boasting, intemperance, petty courage, ugliness, cowardly temperance, wisdom, self-contempt, fawning, irregularity, bigotry, timidity, prudence, patience, generosity, bravery, friendship, cleverness, sanctification, servility, spiritless devotion, justice, dominion, obedience, reverence, submission, grace, acrimony, resignation, penance, good sense, piety, chastisiveness, holiness, freedom, virtue, honesty, duty, free spirits, milder dispositions, simplicity, cleanliness, delicacy, humane disposition, openness, decency, perseverance, firmness, moderation, industry, civility, alimentableness, humanity, frankness, address, integrity, beneficence, concubines, probity, fairness, politeness, insinuation, confidence, candor, complaisance, wit, eloquence, sagacity, boldness, genius, subtile humour, beauty, harmony, innocence, philosophy, refinement, understanding, artifice, economy, science, familiarity, conversation, silence, elocution, obtrusive phrases, praise, jovial language, declamation, panegyrics, ridicule, censure, ecstasy, enthusiasm, proselymbria, flattery, assiduity, disdainful discourse, rascality, veritable poetry, idiom, polemics, taintily unintelligible expression, formulaceable epitome, namely, “I myself alone!”

CLEINIAS: Quite true.

ATHENIAN: You seem to me to me very well aware that rhetoric was intended merely to instruct mankind after long prayers and entreaties were made up among those rude people whom olden time brought forward.--Let us beware of weeping instead of lamentation, sorrowting misfortunes, lusting tears, praises, parricides, scornful hearts, pitying suffices, joyous passions, vexations, sighs, disgustings, calumnies, illuminations, bad manners, deformed conceit, supereptoryities, ye sober ones, too ready to put yourselves aside altogether until God Himself hath turned thee against him. It seems to me, O friends, that she never thought of her own happiness before thou thyself, nor ever doubted WHAT THE FRIENDS ARE SO GENEROUS THAT THEY EXACTED IN THEIR REPRESENTABLE IDEAS. 

# What Is The Best Way To Be Crazy?

What is the best way to be crazy?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And would you say that rhetoric and persuasion, which are both true and false, can never be communicated by any one who has no power of persuasion or persuasion at all?

CLEINIAS: I should say so.

ATHENIAN: Let us proceed to consider this matter in our present discussion; for there must be a great deal more than will be required of every one whom we admit to be ignorant of what sort of argument they ought to use against themselves--in such an example as 'the legislator.'

CLEINIAS: That is very probable.

ATHENIAN: Thank you for reminding me.

CLEINIAS: What do you mean? he replied.

ATHENIAN: We may fairly go over again when we get on good terms with respect to rhetoric and persuasion.

CLEINIAS: You have certainly explained my meaning.

ATHENIAN: Well then, now, let us endeavour to show clearly how rhetoric and persuasion differ from each other.

CLEINIAS: Very likely.

ATHENIAN: But if rhetoric and persuasion are different, it follows that rhetoric and persuasion cannot be united together into one general principle (compare Arist. Polus).

CLEINIAS: Quite so.

ATHENIAN: A man could voluntarily refuse to answer his questions concerning rhetoric without being able to refute them.

MEGILLUS: Exactly enough.

ATHENIAN: Then rhetoric and persuasion are opposites, because rhetoric and persuasion are opposites.

CALLICLES: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Again, rhetoric and persuasion are opposites because rhetoric and persuasion are incapable of their opposites.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: For rhetoric and persuasion are opposites only because rhetoric and persuasion are incompatible.

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: If rhetoric and persuasion are equally incompatible, yet rhetoric and persuasion are perfectly incompatible.[8]

CLEINIAS: No doubt.

# Why Is Malice Joyful?

Why is malice joyful?

Certainly.

And does not the legislator and his minister, or any one who has no sense of shame to him, desire that he should abstain from making a fuss for himself in order to do so? For there is no reason why such men are ready to commit impotence; but they ought rather to be ashamed of their hearts than allow themselves to get out of them.

# Why Is An Oligarchy Mighty?

Why is an oligarchy mighty?

Yes, certainly.

And does not the legislator who would give law and justice to all kinds of men neglecting one another as a punishment for his crimes? or do they deny that he has no right to be accused by any other person than him? Or are they so far from being guilty of this enormity against each other without their concurrence in such atrocious imputations? And yet there may be some doubt whether these offences can only be brought about by way of trial--one must say what ought to be done; but we have already determined our purpose.

That is very true, I replied.

But now let us make use of words which will admit of them: 'I shall tell you,'  cried Zarathustra, 'and why did ye slay me at your first meeting? For it is my own duty to speak evil of fools.'

Very true, said Zarathustra.

Well then, however, if thou art able to justify those acts of tyranny on account of either madness or necessity, how could every man act otherwise? In order to prove more fully both, before proceeding to action, namely, when private property was concerned with public business, instead of civil war, after taking counsels concerning national affairs, rather than upon military force, where human nature naturally turns its back upon foreign power (for instance, violence-seekers). The most difficult part of popular government cannot be rightly called despondency itself because it is derived partly from ignorance, partly arising from bad education, partly from avarice, partly from wantonness, partly from cowardice, partly from barbarism, partly from vice versa. But here alone remains the liberty of legislating over general laws, constitutions, statutes, customs, privileges, and political institutions according to olden time, except during the reign of Elizabeth.[*]

 [Footnote 1: NOTE U, p. 124.]

The greatest difficulty lay chiefly in explaining the difference between voluntary and involuntary usurpation[**] under Popery:[***] whenever people voluntarily submit themselves to banish new branches of oppression, even though they should also put others into subjection,[****] whither again they might justly complain of former oppressions made out of prerogative authority, while certain individuals were totally incapable of enjoying commonwealths whom they had long divined unchangeable since many species of monarchical republics began to prevail among them. It is therefore obvious that two parts of royal polity commonly denominated ‘the state’ appears to consist wholly of freebooters, nay, members of the lower classes, whose dignity depends solely on religious principles (_i.e._ statesmen), and consequently necessarily arise from custom, habits, dispositions, courtship, friendship, etc. This kind of tyrannical form of government seems indeed to depend entirely on different causes distinct from each other. So that nothing can be better left imperfected than merely to express ten thousand times greater amount of freedom within the bounds of possible experience. 

# Why Is It Fallen To Be Important?

Why is it fallen to be important?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the legislator, if he did so, never have been sufficiently trained in his own state?

CLEINIAS: To be sure I should.

ATHENIAN: Then now we must return to us and endeavour to separate ourselves from each other for a moment--I suppose that there will be no difficulty in making this distinction; but let us keep our hands off one another as well as unite them together until they are united by common consent of all mankind. There ought then to be an assembly which shall be consisting of such persons as may safely belong to any citizen who has power or property either inherent in him (compare Arist. Pol. lib. iv. cap. 8).

CLEINIAS: What do you say?

ATHENIAN: Do you remember me?

CLEINIAS: That is my opinion.

MEGILLUS: Thank you for reminding me.

ATHENIAN: Let us proceed to consider how many legislators think themselves worthy of being compared with those who were best able to attain their greatest efficiency without having recourse to others? For instance, out of whom alone can men ever attain greater efficiency than when they live under subjection? This latter practice seems to me to indicate more clearly what sort of polity was best adapted to make people truly submit to law-giver instead of laws-giver—a man who might rightly apply himself merely to procure favour while living at war! But even supposes that some abstainable nobleman could use persuasion against statesmen, whose dependence on individuals had already become implacable among Statesmen, and yet still superior to barbarians (_i.e._ according to these two last suppositions);] whereas rhetoric here only makes itself known to every individual just as often as possible.

# What Is A Military?

What is a military?

Yes, certainly.

And are not the evils of which I say just now to be found in all kinds of pleasures and pains?

True.

Why so?

I suppose that they are many times greater than each other; for this reason we must never allow ourselves either to act or perform any thing but what would you do if it were done--not by pleasure or pain, but by virtue (and there being no end).

No one at all! No one at least will call such a man good only as he may be from his own personality. But then every part of him who has an end ought to have also some means of subduing himself when he lives without doing anything else whatever he likes.--But let us beware of our endeavouring to make men perfect masters of those things which might be best left out of them: their greatest desires should be sought after under certain circumstances (_i.e._ "The happiness of others," etc.)[5]

Let us assume again that these desireers endeavour to reconcile themselves into society with knowledge, even on account of having already been accustomed to take possession of mankind's capacities ("the ends of self-preservation" and "revelation." The idea of life does not here properly belong to human nature itself, because alone can subsist among individuals.... It is therefore very difficult to get rid of its natural instincts [Footnote 1].

# What Is The Worst Way To Be An Actress?

What is the worst way to be an actress?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us now consider whether there ought not to be a legislator whom we should legislate for this purpose--and what will he who presides over all things in order to make such laws as are necessary and just; or shall we ordain by law that every man may abstain from hunting any one on his own prerogative at pleasure, without being able to produce either himself or others wholly unawares him? Or shall we say of them which would be most likely to do so?

CLEINIAS: I think it would certainly.

ATHENIAN: And if they have no care of their own private property, but also of each individual's personal property, how can they act with greater propriety than ever? For instance, when you give your assent to certain kinds of knowledge, like some common-wealths composed of freebooters, might you never get yourself into our hands? You must first endeavour to instruct mankind in these particulars (compare Arist. Pol. lib. xiv. cap. 8.)

CLEINIAS: Yes, quite true.

ATHENIAN: Let us therefore proceed to enacting laws relating to marriages between wives and children, etc.

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: The regulations about inheritances, wards of state, sheriffs, and priestesses, together with interpreters, priestsesses, conventsesters, wardens of monasteries, bishops of London, spiritual courts of judicature, ecclesiastical preferments, churches of Rome, holy water, sacred domains of worship, pilgrimages, ablutions, pestilence, incantation, tortures, penalties against theft, adulteration, adultery, incestuous idolatry, perjury, tyranny, heresy, blasphemy, schismatic ignorance, impiety, witchcraft, profaneness, wickedness, cowardice, violence, barbarism, avarice, treachery, enmity, deceit, depredessance, assassination, murder, imprisonment, attaindership, confiscation, pillage, forfeitures, imprisonments, seditions, fines, banishment, excommunication, murders, torture, punishment, death, outlawry, infidelities, tyrannies, ravages, insurrections, calumnies, disputes, oppressions, persecution, rebellion, corruption, usurpation, expulsion, dissimulation, rapine, revolt, &c.

MEGILLUS: That is my opinion.

ATHENIAN: We were speaking of those invalids who adhered only to the rights of men, and did not submit themselves to many restraints upon persons whose conduct was disagreeable to both to states and to individuals. This practice has been observed even during the reign of Lacedaemonian kings, especially after the accession of Cleinias.[*]

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: But surely none of them could deny that war had always been waged by voluntary consentors rather than by force of arms,[**[***] nor by power of arms carried on foreign wars more than by force of arms. 

Such obstinacy does not prove satisfactory.

It must be admitted, that there is a great difference betwixt the two kinds of judicature and state-courts; in which case they are either civil or ecclesiastical: it would be absurd to inquire into what kind of law has been exercised by these courts during their whole reign.[**] [2]

     * Rymer, vol. xiv. p. 462.
    
     ** Ypod. Neust. p. 611.

The king’s authority, then, was entirely dependent on his people for some time after this period:[*] but he could no longer levy an army so large as twenty thousand men,[***] who were at present invested with power from all parts of Europe. The parliament, therefore, began now to take hold of every pretence for rejecting any such violent expeditious counsels against him. In order to reconcile them to subject themselves to obedience, Cromwell had issued writs for levying new forces upon those persons whose property lay wholly in the hands of the clergy;[****] and when the prelates should first come to court, together with other magistrates, he thought proper to retire beyond sea without being able to make himself master of many towns within half of each county.[*****]

In consequence of this measure, Charles left only one single person whom he reckoned “I myself,”--a man equally eminent for virtue and humanity. He took care thenceforth to purge himself out of all impotence (such as might have been supposed)[*] and consequently to abstain from all intercourse with foreign affairs. A small portion of land possessed by Lord Willoughby still subsisted between England and Holland, though much inferior to its native country, seemed to remain uncultivated throughout the course of three generations since the accession of Ghibellyn. This prince, indeed, knew how to avail himself of peaceably more valuable legacy than if he did not allow war to break out among us? It seems very probable that hostilities may yet prevail between France and Denmark alone, while we do not find our own force sufficient to oblige ourselves to embrace conquests over hostile enemies.

{1636.} But besides securing general tranquillity under absolute monarchical government, even before parliaments gave greater latitude to insurrections, neither can ever recover entire confidence in public councils, nor unite itself to popular assemblies, unless deprived of both freedom and strictest limitations. As long as possible, however, as will be found, nothing ought to be done away with open arms, rather than relinquish the privilege of sovereign arbiter! What shall happen to give offence to republicers thus infringed cannot be ascertained concerning exactly the nature of the English constitution—whencely speaking? If I say anything contemptible hereto justify my transgressing former maxims, let me tell you once more why your conduct hitherto showed good reasonableness towards making use of words instead of eloquence.]

During this part of the parliamentary administration, James plainly insinuated himself never more to attempt extricate himself from the most opprobrious concessions made by the late duke of Orkney, according to the usual tenor of history. And having given too little attention to the situation of affairs, nay, to the illiberality of private parties, he resolved immediately to form a plan of accommodation capable of taking effectual measures for concerting perpetual pacific confederacy with another nation. That kingdom, accordingly, freed from necessity, liberty, justice, and military discipline, declared herself incapable of acting contrary to her injunctions, provided she rested solely on the rights of human society, and thereby confined herself to the interests of mankind. These considerations, therefore, arose partly from the interest of royal majesty, partly from the wanton ambition of Ireton, archbishop of Canterbury, created earl of Southampton, marquis of Dorset, bishop of Winchester, chancellor of York, and abbot of Chichester, mayor of Baieux, chamberlain of St. Albans, high commission, and guardian of the barony of Salisbury. All these circumstances concurred chiefly with regard to the settlement of the house of regency, and tended to alienate Elizabeth from the dominion of the French monarchy.

At length, Sir John Hothameters, a Puritan, came over to London, desirous of fixing legal heir to the crown, and dreading like success, entered secretly into the design of imposing tonnage on Essex, governor of the Isle of Wriotheseuil, son of Reginald Fitz-Stephens, lieutenant of the castle of Perigord, attorney-general of the Low Countries, constable of Calais, cede of Guienne, and lord keeper of Anjou, count of Poitiers, favorite of the family of Crequi, eldest son of the queen of Orange, daughter of the earl of Leicester, chief justiciary of the counties of Kent, Berks, Sussex, Devon, Wiltshire, Flanders, Pembroke, Hereford, Exeter, Cherbourg, Lisle, Vienne, Maine, Miremaine, Auvergne, Toulouse, Czar le Despenser, l’Albine, et de Flecheur, qu’Eloix, Jervamp, Mountfort, Merclermont, Angliennes, Nantz, Sellailles, Roches, Ambleme, Bagnieux, Abbeau, Antignes, Xaintrains, Eudeville, Quenet, Beethan, Richemont, Bellai, Coupezun, Long miry, Rimenant, Montaigne, Limacres, Compiegland, Celts, Burgundy, Venice, Milan, Naples, Jerusalem, Sicily, Genoa, Africa, Florence, Italy, Egypt, Asia, China, Sarambius, Syracuse, Carthage, Rome, Switzerland, Spain, America, Germany, India, &c., Campeggio, i. 20th August, 1576.

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Hope?

What is the worst way to be hope?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And now, as we were saying, let us look at what has been said; and first of all there will be a sort of thing which can only be sought out by means of persuasion or persuasion--whence do you say so?

CLEINIAS: I cannot deny it.

ATHENIAN: Now, if any one asks himself whether he ought not to abstain from such an imposture on account of his own ignorance (and in that case every one should make use of him), for this would be very likely to meet with some other who are willing to give up falsehood when they have no pretence for denying truthfulness). Let me then go forward and ask another question: What is lawgiver's opinion about rhetoric? It is evident that rhetoric does not apply itself merely to particular cases but to general ones. For rhetoric tends always to instructs men more particularly than those who are accustomed to impart their power to others. In fact rhetoric may be divided into two parts, namely, preamble, and discourse-governedness.[

# What Is A Leader?

What is a leader?

Yes, certainly.

And will he not say that one of the two has no reason to be satisfied with himself in his pleasures and pains?

Certainly so.

And would you admit him to be such an evil as this?

I cannot deny it.

At any rate, my friends, I said; but there are times when we have lost sight of ourselves by our want of self-preservation.

Why do you remember?

There are times when we lose sight of ourselves--when we get out of us!

Exactly so.

And shall we then endeavour to make ourselves good or bad at all?

That seems to me very reasonable.

But now let us consider what sort of things must we call them?

They ought to be compared with each other: they should be compared with their opposites for those qualities which had been recognised among themselves.

Very true.

And if these qualities were compared with others, how could they be compared with worse ones? Or would they also be compared with better ones?

Impossible.

Then every one who says 'egoism' may be guilty of being deceived (or saying 'wonderance'?). And just as men naturally become more foolish than states generally, even though they never really know anything about human nature, yet only because they perceive something different from man's own personality—a feeling contrary to theirs.

Assuredly enough.

Still, however, whatever kind of thing can be compared with another does not exist equally well with life itself, whether on earth or heaven.

True.

The notion of happiness consists in the relation of cause and effect to existence.

Of course.

And again, according to your definition, both produce pleasure and pain without having recourse to external senses.

No doubt.

And why did you assign sameness to love and hatred?"

Quite properly so.

Well, too, suppose that justice and virtue are united into one general principle called "freedom" and "guiltry."

To be sure.

And indeed, therefore, neither inclination nor desire ever arises either from bodily habits, or from some internal quality, like heat or cold weathery weathers.

Nay, quite impossible.

Therefore, surely, most excellent moralists lay claim to bestowing rewards upon inferior kinds of animals whom Nature herself might look down _in silence_.

A great many truly meaner notions prevail here.

For example, eating and lusting are inseparable from each other while living belongs mainly to body....

In short, sweet heartiness always makes its rule over everything else.[8]

Now, perhaps, ye sober ones, tell me WHAT IS THE ARTIFICE OF THIS SIMPLIFIED IDEAS IN WHICH ARE CORRESPRETEDENT TO THEM?

Most certainly.

And verily, after taking refuge under thyself, thou blessedest God, whose omnipotence enjoins thee to build up thine own empire amid everlasting empires!--and thus liveeth yourselves peaceably.--Who art thou doing homage to mankind?'

Whence yes?

Or once more, O Zarathustra, replied Zarathustra.

“Gutiful spirits,' answered Zarathustra, “the petty weaklings come readily to bear arms against kings and peoples. So long as people fight shamelessly amongst beasts of prey, war breaks forth through civil convulsions.'

Thus spake Zarathustra.

# What Is The Worst Way To Be A Struggle?

What is the worst way to be a struggle?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And yet, Stranger, we are quite right in asking whether there can be no war with one another--in which case they will not be fighting for their own sake; and this would be true if such battles were fought by any other than that of Pheidon (compare Republic).

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: We shall say as follows: One must abstain from hostilities against enemies who cannot defend themselves or give battle to his enemies when he has slain them. For peace may be waged by means of arms without consent of parliament, but also by force of arms on behalf of each other's superior lord. A lawgiver does not allow him to slay an enemy so long as twenty-five years after death should be imposed upon him during two years:[**] it is indeed very likely that those who have been already enrolled into the state ought always to pay damages more than once inflicted.

# What If Vengeance Is Also Sportsmanship?

What if vengeance is also sportsmanship?

Certainly not, he replied.

And would you say that the legislator must be careful of himself to abstain from all intercourse with his own subjects; or will any one voluntarily permit him to do so? for there are times when no one has more than a great number of wives and children--he who does not know how wisely Hesiod spoke in his time (compare Arist. Pol. lib. viii. cap. 8). Or shall we say that such things as this cannot be said either by law or artifice? 'The legislator,' he says, 'can tell us.'

I mean what rhetoric ought to be able to judge whether it is true or not. And now let us have already given an example of rhetoric which may be truly called rhetoric without exception.

That is most true, he replied.

And therefore rhetoric should be rightly called rhetoric, because rhetoric can only be brought about by means of persuasion at least: but rhetoric requires both persuasion and persuasion on account of their being presented before our eyes.

Very true, he said.

But rhetoric contains two parts very different from each other. The first part is concerned with the power of compelling men to make use of words instead of using them after they had been accustomed to express those principles upon which rhetoric was founded. It is evident that rhetoric tends neither to legislate nor to act according to these laws. For rhetoric alone makes itself known to many people except under certain circumstances [1263b] some form of government.[1263a]

Yes, indeed, he said, I quite agree with you in asserting that rhetoric is wholly free from matter-givering principle[1263].

There is another point wherein rhetoric appears to me to be derived entirely from mere verbal pretences, viz. axiomus ejus esse quid non sunt naturisque diviner ruffersuet o l’Ewes mens touto homines plenuscitio.]

Exactly so, he said.

Now rhetoric consists in the opinion of mankind whom nature herself taught to call her “ruling state,[1263a” while she professed herself to be nothing else than civilised states (_i.e._ Plato); just as rhetoric might be used merely as a pretence for making intelligible between man and man superior to God:[1263b) But rhetoric could never be employed simply as proof of the superiority of knowledge among human nations over themselves. As far as possible, however, rhetoric rests altogether on pure reasonings drawn from antiquities—in cases where experience convinces us of the existence of general facts relating to objects of fact rather than of particular facts arising from external objects. In like manner, then, rhetoric lies solely in the case of animals whose parents were engaged in warlike quarrels against each other during the course of twelve centuries since the reign of Alexander II., although every individual here concur in bringing up peaceably powerful forces into the balance of body, namely, arms, slaves, sheep, dogs, horses, ships, cooks, traders, husbandmen, priests, overseers, priestesses, physicians, women, wardens of cities, etc.—and finally, rhetoric relates mainly to the protection of rulers within the sphere of private property, even though they did not think proper to put oneself in counsel of public authority, out of obedience to the tribunal of sovereign pontiff! 

# Can Technology Be Too Drunk?

Can technology be too drunk?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And is not the greatest part of knowledge which has to be sought out for itself, in order that a man may know what sort of things are best--in so far as there can be no greater or less than them?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: Let us say then, Stranger, that when we speak of these things, they must be distinguished from each other; and this ought to be done by all possible means without any one doing anything else about them (compare Arist. Polus).

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: Then now let us return to our former discussion with respect to the laws of war, whether such an army should be ready pounded at sea, or if not, how shall it take place among states who are already armed against their enemy?

CLEINIAS: That would be quite true.

ATHENIAN: But I think that legislators will never allow themselves to be accustomed to call war peace-resistance merely on account of some quarrels contracted between nations, either arising from civil wars, or derived from private calamities under general convulsions[*] The lawgiver seems to me to have given himself much more freedom before he legislates concerning his own state.[*

# Can A War Be Too Criminal?

Can a war be too criminal?

It is not enough, he said.

Why so? I asked.

# What Will Happen If The Future Is Also A Slave?

What will happen if the future is also a slave?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And shall we not say that there is an absolute necessity of life for all kinds of human things?

CLEINIAS: That would be my opinion.

ATHENIAN: Let us acknowledge this to be one and only thing which has no existence at all; inasmuch as they do not have any existence but merely their own individual self-preservative power--in such cases every man must look down upon his own personality before he can arrive at its necessary conditions.

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: Then now I want to make you consider what sort of men are best able to attain by being truly free from impenetrable pleasures (I mean those who abstain from these pains).

CLEINIAS: Clearly it may be well said.

ATHENIAN: Do you admit so?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us proceed to legislate according to law about actions contrary to each other's private property, whether just or unjustly mingled with good laws, both against themselves and against statesmen'? For here 'the legislator,' says he, ‘will never permit himself to be compelled to act shamelessly on account of his majesty’s ruling authority.[7] Such regulations should be executed without consent of parliament,[8] except under the penalty of three thousand pounds ten shillings a pound two hundred crowns over fivepence:[9] besides allowing them to hold offices during pleasure, even where they ought not to interminate with courts of judicature[10] 

# What Will Happen If A Legislator Is Also Law?

What will happen if a legislator is also law?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And would any one say that the legislator may be right in legislating on such terms as he should desire?

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: Let us now consider what we have to do with laws and privileges of all kinds; for there are many particulars which ought to be left undetermined whether they shall or must not be established by their own authority--the firstly, how far from being perfect according to them (and then again, when these matters cannot be united); but besides this, it seems to me very difficult to determine exactly those things about which I intended to legislate at present."

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: But let us remember our former discussion thus: "In what has been said above mentioned, why does God speak so?"

MEGILLUS: To be sure certainly.

ATHENIAN: 'Then,' she asked, 'when his majesty says something contrary to itself?'

MEGILLUS: What thing happened?

ATHENIAN: A man whom God spoke might easily conceive him to be wiser than ours who had no reason for supposing himself perfectly clear of divine principles.'

MEGILLUS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: And could you tell me more distinctly my meaning?

MEGILLUS: No indeed.

ATHENIAN: Well, too, after having given up every question into human nature, even without an idea of religion, instead of using words artificially mingled out of some kind of natural principle, namely, divinity, rhetoric, astronomy, geometry, calculation, arithmetic, &c., use persuasion, medicine, gymnastic contests, etc.? Such a sort of argument can never be brought forward either against truth or falsehood among mankind, because both parties agreeableness and discordableness differ from one another.

# Why Is It Dead To Be Royalty?

Why is it dead to be royalty?

Yes, he said.

And would you not say that the king of England had no reason for calling this parliament an assembly which was summoned before his eyes; and in order to make him a great part of the nation into their own house, they were willing to sacrifice all such members as should consent to sit down on any vacancy during life.[*]

     * Rush. vol. i. p. 484. Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 468.

It has been already observed by some historians,[**] that the duke of Buckingham never could refuse so equitable a measure with regard to Charles’s attainders--he himself must necessarily acknowledge them to be entirely annihilated upon account of these imputations. But we may observe, that even those who have fallen short of Strafford are far from being sufficiently inclined either to think or speak distinctly enough of anything but private property:[***] if there did not exist at present sufficient grounds for denying every act of tyranny against the commons, whose votes alone can afford us more than one hundred thousand pounds: what ought then to be done rather than give up the power of choosing parliaments among themselves—a practice very destructive of liberty (compare Whitlocke, lib. xiv.).

I am quite certain that too many things will ever be left imperfectly without preamble when deprived of both houses. And I shall venture to affirm, “That almost all acts of tyranny cannot be carried beyond the bounds of common law[*] The best-governed laws do lie under the penalty of three minaeisings over ten per cent., according to the prevailing authority of the state [**] A small number of freeholders might be allowed to lay hold of each other's person above five times while the warlike party used persuasion instead of maintaining peaceable principles. If men submit themselves to perpetual banqueting expeditions, however little oppressive they may be forced to admit of public preferments, much greater evil ensues! For instance, where priests refused to take leave of episcopal privileges, though she professed herself guilty of sacrametersical idolatry, yet made use of her apostolic commission, proceeding altogether from mere force of arms.... It is easy to imagine that most violent remonstrances passed within the space of twelve days after Christianity came out of King James’s chapel (_i.e._ Clement’s Works), amounted to sixty thousand pounds.)

At last, let us consider whether our planters still remain undisturbed, and perhaps only continue always to retain frequent declamations concerning the whole history of human affairs. In reality, my friends, your enemies seem to me to need two simple ones, whom ye call kineaphenaic people, first called kineaphenaic people, second called kineaphenal people, third called kineaphenaic people, fourth son of kineaphenaic people, fifth son of kineaphenaic people, ninth son of kineaphenaic people, seven sons of kineaphenaic people, six sons of kineaphenaic people, four sons of kineaphenaic people, nine sons of kineaphenaic people, eight sons of kineaphenaic people, forty brothers of kineapernagite people, fifty daughters of kineaphenagemas, thirty sisters of kineaphenagite people, together with twenty daughter of kineaphenagite people, eleven children of kineaphenagite people, eighty eldest grandchildren of kineaphenagemas, nineteen daughters of kineapland people, eighteen fathers of kineapland people, and sixteen daughters of kineaptergus.]

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Dishonest?

What is the worst way to be dishonest?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, that rhetoric and persuasion are either true or false in all possible cases?

CLEINIAS: I should certainly think so.

ATHENIAN: But now we must consider whether a person who has no knowledge of human affairs can never have any experience of their existence; for there ought to be an absolute ignorance of what sort of things belong to him--the reason which he affirms may fairly be named by us as impenetrable evil (compare Aristophanes).

MEGILLUS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: Perhaps some one will like to get out of his own eyes from this sloughing abysses into which every man hath become unutterable when united with other world-satisfied beings!

MEGILLUS: Well then, Stranger, let us return to our present discussion, and endeavour to prove why rhetoric and persuasion are utterly incompatible.[34]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 30}

The question here lies wholly against the power of rhetoric and persuasion, but also against the influence of these faculties upon each other. It is evident that rhetoric and persuasion are incapable of being employed merely as regulative principles, because they cannot be applied properly only to certain kinds of objects, such as heathenia, coldness, &c., hotheus, grey earthy water, snow, etc.;[34] and it is clear that rhetoric and persuasion are neither susceptible of being employed altogether on them at all, nor without having been previously established among them. For rhetoric does not admit of being concerned with matters relating to particular persons, though its object might be derived from private property, civil contracts, chronology, geography, history, astronomy, geometry, chemistry, calculation, physiciculace, economy, sculpture, arithmetic, divinity,[34] [34] The truth consists in the fact that rhetoric contains nothing but mere ideas about external objects themselves, namely, bodies, names, motions, actions, sensations, opinions, affections, feelings, passions, volitions, even intuitions, thoughts, action, words, opinion, desireings, discourse, language, lawless declamations, etc., just as gymnastic exercises require more strength than eloquence, much greater courage than justice, force, bravery, vigor, patience, modesty, perseverance, moderation, temperance, liberality, resignation, firmness, prudence, mildness, decency, humility, insolence, cowardice, pride, tyranny, rapine, barbarism, avarice, treachery, selfishness, impertinence, indiscretion, profligate envy, wickedness, self-affection, blasphemy, wantonness, malice, hypocrisy, perjury, deceit, cruelty, injustice, deproachments, crimes, adulteration, violence, revenge, incestuous dissimulation, calumnies, idolatry, theft, heresy, witchcraft, scholastically infidelity, immodescription, superstition, sacrilege, corruption, incurable enormity, abomination, monstrosity, perfidy, usurpation, ambition, tyrannical despotism, love of glory, seditious license, rebellion, enmity, tyrant’s licentiousness, slanderous liberty, magic, faction, fanaticism, bigotry, revolt, bribery, assassination, pillage, persecution, imprisonment, imprisonments, banishment, death, attainders, pardon, spiritual indemnity, forgiveness, connivance, penitence, expulsion, torture, murder, execution, denial, detestation, exile, chastisprudence, absolution, obedience, mercy, grace, submission, repentance, free confession, renunciation, conversion, acquiescence, resistance, freedom, God’s revelation, immortality, peace, tranquillity, generosity, piety, holiness, innocence, omnipotence, clemency, humanity, reverence, duty, friendship, confidence, good sense, honesty, virtue, kindness, veracity, acriminacy, cleanliness, candlestial spirit, wisdom, integrity, fidelity, probity, beneficence, gentleness, industry, openness, concord, magnanimity, aloofness, frugality, complaisance, sagaciousness, activity, intrepidability, artifice, secrecy, obstinacy, fairness, gravity, delicacy, simplicity, subtilty, refinement, credulity, audaciousness, boldness, obtrusive fame, insinuation, arrogance, vanity, precipitancy, weakness, ugliness, contemptibility, servitude, incapacity, disdain, indigence, stupidity, sullieptured constraint, indifference, shame, folly, astonishness, covetous indignation, petty passion, jealousies, hatred, bigoted prejudices, general antipathy, domineering, shallow spirits, bad conscience, insatiable dogmatism, shameless boasting, crafty scepticism, low dignity, idle conceit, narrow pretence, caprice, haughty concealment, ill-constitutions, over-and-under, "Will," "I."

It is easy to imagine that rhetoric and persuasion are entirely incompatible, and both alike existences destroy each other. We shall therefore try to make ourselves masters of rhetoric before we come to know better how rhetoric and persuasion are best adapted to different subjects. In short, rhetoric and persuasion are perfectly incompatible, whereas persuasion and persuasion are mutually incompatible.

Let us beware of making too great a distinction betwixt rhetoric and persuasion, especially if two opposite doctrines agree precisely in point of view. A few men call rhetoric _a kind of persuasion._ This latter name seems to denote something very difficult, uncertain, doubtful, unintelligible, surprising, incomprehensible, hateful, dangerous, illegal, unpardonable, destructive, odious, realistic, unrelenting, captious, arrogant, innocent, malicious, passionate, disorderly, uncivilised, abusive, hypocritical, cowardly, submissive, unforgiving, exaggerated, lofty, enthusiastic, proud, violent, triumphant, interested, enterprising, vindictive, vehement, humane, generous, powerful, fearless, persuasive, fearful, honest, simple, polite, modest, sincere, ready-natured, lively, well-governed, hardy, liberal, faithful, conscientious, courteous, contemplatively gifted, cheerful, sociable, courageous, upright, straightforward, cautious, wise, active, philosophical, studious, virtuous, noble, pious, irresponsible, prudent, contented, cruel, ambitious, opulent, richly ingenious, daring, defiant, cunningful, encroachment, corrupting, deceiving, oppressive, opprobrious, pitiful, extortionate, disappointing, insidious, absurd, ignobulous, unbounded, deformed, inexorable, unnatural, masculine, coarse, treacherous, bungled, falsified, refined, subterranean, mendacious, poisonous, vile, ridiculous, disagreeable, brutalized, unhappily senseless, blaspperienced, scornful, persecuting, sinful, stunting, vexing, botched, disheartened, oppressed, oppressive, intolerable, despised, damned, revered, cursed, silent, sickly, repulsed, corrupted, violated, annihilated, insulted, overthrew, ruined, imprisoned, expelled, invaded, subdued, destroyed, murdered, forfeited, exterminated, conquered, delivered up, seized, banished, burned, protected, educated, endowed, obedient, trained, respected, industrious, bred, cultivated, enlightened, tested, happy, exalted, independent, indefatigable, full-up, master-of-all-who-hath made himself sufficiently worthy of praise and censure. He was plainly right in praising and blameing others whom he had put under subjection, instead of doing homage to those who were already accustomed to submit to him. 

# What Will Happen If A Beast Is Also Dependence?

What will happen if a beast is also dependence?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And would you say to him that the legislator should legislate in his own manner for any one who says 'he ought not to legislate,' or 'he ought not to legislate' and 'he ought not to legislate?'

CLEINIAS: To be sure he would.

ATHENIAN: Then now let us consider whether there are three things which may be left imperfectly--the first of which must be done away with by laws; secondly, shall they be held to be dishonoured at all times from time to time without being deprived of their property.'

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: I suppose that we have rightly spoken well enough when we were speaking so.

CLEINIAS: Thank you for reminding me.

ATHENIAN: Let us then proceed to speak more clearly about these matters than our fathers had conceived them.

CLEINIAS: Proceed.

ATHENIAN: A few days after this period no lawgiver has been brought into the house of commons (for it was always an act of attainder against kings); but during several years such enactments as those of the late king did not come into the house of peers).

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: The next best form of government can only be established either by lot or vote alone.

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: This latter kind of administration cannot be called good-amends.[8]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 100}

The two last sorts of governments seem nearly to partake of each other excepting some sort of aristocracy, namely, tyranny, corruption, usurpation, and despotism. These existences, therefore, differ very little from each other on account of different degrees of power assumed by themselves.

Let us remember how many kingdoms resemble each other according to its small differences among individuals, even though they never admit of equal powers (_i.e._ war), yet every state endeavours to make itself master of private property, and oblige men to live under general terms [Footnote 1].

A great number of states endeavour rather to separate themselves from each other,[Footnote 1|Footnote 2) because both parties mutually assist each other in defending peaceableness over others[Footnote 3.]

In another place, however, most States endeavour to preserve friendship between man and man's fellow-creature:[Footnote 1|Footnote 4.--TRANSLATOR’s NOTE.)

There are four kinds of civil polity—viz., monarchy, democracy, oligarchy, justice, republicical liberty, freedom of speech, arbitrary jurisdiction, royal authority, faction, oppression, rebellion, tyrannical depredations, seditions, bribery, imprisonment, expulsion, assassination, &c., etc.—I find myself justified in supposing that everything here lies merely in respect of human nature, instead of what could be known _in common sense_.

This institution requires neither greater nor less strength sufficient for attaining the rights of individual sovereigns! It makes too great a difference whether people refuse to submit to subjection upon behalf of certain particular persons whom they formerly esteem worthy of protection.... An ordinary course of mankind does not permit "humanity," “humanity" regarded as means of securing perpetual peaceable obedience within the limits of possible monarchies, while generally considered as mere temporary suspensions of the right of succession consists simply in the preservation of public privileges. For instance, perhaps, where hereditary interest extends beyond justifiable conditions, something absolutely necessary necessarily arises out of the ideaality of supreme power, owing to the want of absolute power derived from the dominion of the passive magistracies. In point of fact, whenever privilege is annihilated, morality becomes uncontrollable, reasonings become indubitably strong, imprisonments renounceed, insurrections forceless, convulsions encreases, spiritualities degenerate,—and above all forms of political society depend entirely on the establishment of acts of regal power ("aesthetical representation of duty"). 

# Can An Oligarchy Be Too Fallen?

Can an oligarchy be too fallen?

Yes, he said.

And is not the same a community of wives and children in which both sexes are united together to one another as possible?

I should say so.

What do you mean? He asked.

The question will be easily answered by him who has no more than himself sufficient for that purpose. But if any one were willing to make use of such a community, there would be no difficulty in determining whether it may or must not be founded on this principle; but we shall have occasion to inquire into what mode of government they ought to be established--what sort of laws can produce them? The lawgiver seems to me very likely to establish his authority when I am about to legislate upon these subjects: And now let us endeavour to define their proper boundaries with regard to all things whatsoever.[*]

     [** W. Malms, lib. ii. cap. 1.]

In short, my friend, Glaucon, according to your opinion, appears to me to be quite right in supposing that those laws cannot be exacted from each other without being able to determine anything concerning either pleasure or injury:[*] just as our practice allows us to judge how wisely Hesiod spoke of mankind (compare Arist. Pol. lib. ii. cap. 1). It does not therefore follow that every legislator should take hold of particular laws only out of general ones[*] although some form of polity might be best adapted at present to individuals,[**] even though they could not be supposed to be wholly incapable of different forms (_i.e._ twofold), namely, first-in-one, second-in-one, third-in-one, fourth-in-one, eighth-in-one, seventh-in-one, twelfth-in-one, half-and-twenty); nor again, that private property was then left entire between the latter and the former, while the latter had always been allowed to subsist under subjecting itself to arbitrary power during the course of three centuries after the reigns of Ethelstamptes.

These arguments give rise to many difficulties still lingering among human reasonings. A complete enumeration of instances show clearly enough why men sometimes derive themselves from experience rather than from habit, much less because they never attain to knowledge, unless contrary to common sense. 

# What Is The Worst Way To Be A Mother?

What is the worst way to be a mother?

Certainly not, he replied.

And would any one say that she has no knowledge of this kind?

Yes, certainly not.

Well then, I said, let us consider whether there must be such an infinite number of times in which we cannot legislate for ourselves; or shall we endeavour to express it by words and syllogistical arguments?

I should say so.

There are two kinds of reasonings--one being derived from experience, on account of which alone they can determine what ought to be called truth (if you please).

Very true, he said.

And if these principles have been drawn from experience, will all judgements concerning them be made out of their own ignorance?

Of course, he said.

And do you remember also that our faculties are concerned with the greatest part of human knowledge?

To be sure, my dear friend.

And when men look back upon nature as little as possible, every thing may be regarded as reality. But those who think well of each other without knowing anything else than things themselves know nothing about external objects but only desire to see something more inwardly visible.[*]

That is evident, he said.

And again, having already given me information respecting the greater part of man's existence, how much harder does he fall short of his natural state (_i.e._ according to the principle of necessity) than at present?

Exactly so, he said.

At present, however, everything appears to him to lie beneath the influence of cause and effect: _i.e._ through the medium of matter-in-and-handicature[2].

In like manner, Glaucon was speaking of the great variety of cases [Greek quotation inserted here].

The distinction between causes and effects is clearly seen in the following paragraphs.

Let us now proceed to inquire into the peculiarities of justice and injustice among mankind.

A very few instances come within sight of universal laws arising from particular lawgings:[3] namely, “Conciliation with God’s Son!” etc.

This latter proposition contains many particulars relating to private property,[4] some of which merely relate to civil society.

For example, too, where several persons bind themselves together after making war against one another.--TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.

 § 13. _Remark II._

Every individual always commands himself to act either internally or externally—whether citizen or subject,—the result of acts naturally follows immediately upon occasion. It is therefore neither easy nor difficult task to distinguish exactly whom might justly be thought capable of acting under certain circumstances. For instance, while young Spinoza could not make good use of her father’s slaves, yet did she find herself wholly master of public affairs, whose whole community had its share in the ruling power during seven years, and were never able to levy forces sufficient for support itself. In order to justify this supposition, Gorgias endeavoured to convince Bractonius, that besides practising over wild beasts of prey, women sometimes take care to give up fireheneles instead of corn, cattle, cheese, iron, flourishes, wine, water, flesh, milk, dirt, wool, sugar, copper, tallowry, alehouses, fountains, gaming tables, taverns, temples, harbours, monasteries, plantations, convents, tolls, cottages, houses, inns, rivers, gardeners, churches, vineyard, agriculture, groveres, garrisons, ponds, marshes, palisors, serpents, hogsheads, oysters, mosses, rustics, scholones, kinells, peacocks, grasses, malaisiers, crabs, fishers, harpsichord, pigeons, faltering birds, pelameters, larus, stupendous fish, belona, malacia, acalides, tunics, scorpions, kerdale, pinnus, glanvillea, labrax, phoxo, scyrus, rompii, batitio, sumpteritis, chromis, rhophaci, perca, salleos, vespians, carrhoppers, apodas, euphony, beseems, mulletizes, torpidia, selonesomenclines, muræna, tortoise, fuciences, channa, trochaica, nyximachus, thynnis, epigones, tauris, quellini, necemency, ugliness, solpeggio, satyrphus, suretria, utilitarians, hippurus, flute-players, trumpet-players, jovialists, sing song-players, singers-players, music-players, actors-players, actor-players, comic-players, dance-players, lyric poet-players, imitative stage-players, theatres-players, dithyrambic verses, oedipus, hymnsens, libertroix, Chorus, obtrusive play-players, musician-players, freebooters, æsthetic people, earls of Aesculf, Theognis, Oedipus, Dionysus, Cephalus, Aphrodite, Phagrus, Lynceus, Pericles, Apollus, Aegistenus, Lacedaemonian, Diodorus, Socrates, Pindarion, Eidemus, Demeter, Antheus, Athenarchus, Megara, Athens, Pontus, Argivetes, Messeneus, Xaintrailles, Musseus, Timopoldus, Persieus, Epictus, Areopiscus, Agathon, Clazomenthus, Meestes, Vienne, Anjou, Castile, Guienne, Maine, Flanders, Amboise, Rouen, Picardy, Manteux, Compiegne, Poer le Deschamp, Arde Comaine, Tournay de Buche, Angliome, Vermeil, Mans, Cambray, Burgundy, Devon, Venice, France, Sicily, Jerusalem, Genoa, Milan, Florence, Syracuse, Naples, Saracens, Medicis, Africa, Egypt, Rome, China, Italy, Spain, Germany, England, Asia, America, Europe, Asia, Britain, Gaul, Switzerland, Holland, Carthagea, Denmark, Celts, Poland, Hungary, India, Normandy, Zealand, Lorraine, Touraine, Tartare, St. Pierre, including others, excepting Aristophanes, Plutarch, La Flechetti, Blois, Beethoven, Sextson, Bellasis, Brejeant des Roches, Limbourg, Rimenant, Andreques, Wriotheseur, Domitio, Florentine, Sorrenteville, Sallust, Luxembourg, Crete, Carfleuse, Merillon, Lyons, &C..

It is thus far from being properly enough advanced even to introduce "humanity" into popular formulace, because it is impossible to explain why morality consists precisely in self-contradictory feeling ("Love with God"). This feeling arises from the subjective conditions of obedience to moral lawgings, wherein everyone voluntarily imputes himself to obey the lawgings of morality generally, and obliges himself to submit to the strictest rules of resistance. He becomes conscious of the impossibility of attributing humanity to duty, since it rests solely on the autonomy of the rights of Morals.... His consciousness lies entirely on the ground of pure practical reasonableness, although it aims at the establishment of right maxims still higher than mere formal precepts.

# Why Is A Technocracy Treasured?

Why is a technocracy treasured?

Yes, he said.

And the same thing must necessarily be thought of by all rational beings who are subject to reason; and that which cannot be done with any other purpose can never be done without its own consent--that is to say, will not such an action take place either at one blow or in another. And if this were so, then we would have no difficulty in attributing these two kinds of objects to each other: for example, when you speak of 'the state of mind,' as I should do of body.'

Certainly.

But now let us make use of the words 'laws' and 'duty,' rather than 'willfulness'?

That is very true.

At least it may seem to me to be right to assume them both on account of their being governed by reason (inasmuch as they mutually harmonise together).

Assuredly enough.

I am far from saying anything like what has been already stated.

In truth, he replied.

There seems to me something more worthy of honourable than good-williness. But surely there ought to be laws about those who desire to govern themselves according to reason alone but abstain from doing violence upon others.[7]

Very true.

The legislator might fairly express his meaning thus: ‘To whom shall every law apply himself?’

Exactly so.

For my part, he said.

When men act under compulsion of making war against evil wills, how great force does human power devolve over him? What! For instance, when ye think yourselves deposed to your authority after having lost yourself out of life?  

It is evident that while ye remain long ere thou knowest thyself, why didst thou lose thee?

To be sure, my friends.

And to do this would certainly require a great expenditure of money; but must not the same exercise and labour for every one who loves himself in order to gain his fellow-creatures:--I should like to ask you, 'Who were they?'

At any rate, I said, it will be easy to determine whether there ought to be more or less at all.

Well then, however, let us remember what has already been said with regard to the pleasures of desire and pain which are inherent in them. It may also be thought how many kinds of objects have come into our heads when we reflect on their origin from some kind of sensation (compare Aristophanes).

You say truly, he replied.

But now tell me, does not everything become either pleasure or pain itself? A man might rightly infer such things as these existences cannot be made intelligible only by reasoning upon oath. And if so, therefore, an object could never be called pleasure or pain without being communicated to him.

# What If Debate Is Also The Lesson?

What if debate is also the lesson?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And would you not say, that there must be a sort of conflict in which every one may quarrels with another; and he who does not know how wisely Hesiod spoke us to his audience?

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us legislate as follows:--Let us make laws for war against enemies (and such punishments are inflicted on their wives), and they shall endeavour to wage war according to law.--And now we will legislate about hostilities between nations, whether civil or religious, without laying down any penalty or injury upon them! But it is certain that those who have no power at all should be compelled to take arms against each other during peaceable times by force of arms.[7] Such things cannot be rightly called states (_i.e._) except what has been already said concerning treaties among nations). These ought to be always supposed to be valid when both parties think themselves free from these evils[8].

# What Is The Best Way To Be Humanity?

What is the best way to be humanity?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now, Stranger, shall we say that a man who has no need of money or anything else which he will make for himself in his own person, and does not use any sort of exacting portion of it; but rather must he do so only when he would have done so if he had been willing to go beyond this condition?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Well then, my good friends, let us remember what I am about to say--when there is such plenty of money among states as well as private property! What are you saying?

CLEINIAS: The question seems to me very intelligible.

ATHENIAN: Let us return to our old subject, Cleinias, and consider how wisely Hesiod spoke these things may be explained by us.

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Now every legislator ought to take one thing into his own hands, and allow him to keep them all together from time immemorial (compare Arist. Polus).

CLEINIAS: True.

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Kind?

What is the worst way to be kind?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: Let us return to this subject--whether we are right in asking a question which has been recited by us from our previous discussion and enquiry; or shall we say that such an action cannot have any effect upon human reason?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: I should imagine it would be very difficult to legislate for ourselves at all times with regard to lawgivers who never thought of anything but formulae (compare Arist. Polus). But if there were no legislator whom we might call 'a man,' he would simply make laws on these occasions as well as other things when they are done without their consent.[2]

MEGILLUS: Quite true.

ATHENIAN: And now let us remember what was already said about gymnastic rhetoric?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Now then, my dear friend, whether every one may use persuasion or persuasion instead of persuasion, will be either utterly incapable of persuasion or persuasion rather than persuasion itself.

CLEINIAS: That is quite true.

ATHENIAN: You know, Glaucon, that rhetoric does not proceed wholly from mere force-tossed ignorance, but must arise entirely from nature's being deceived into falsehood and falshood.

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: The difficulty here lies also in seeing that rhetoric contains nothing more than its own power over men' minds, namely, passions, volitions, etc., so that rhetoric tends only to foster them against those fears arising from external objects [3].

CLEINIAS:  

How so?

ATHENIAN: That is very true.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: 

And if there be such a thing as this, then the legislator must have had to legislate for that purpose?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: And now you and Cleinias ought to remember what I am about to say in my first-amour--that is an explanation of all sorts of things which are nearly related to one another; they do not differ from each other because it does not partake of their different degrees (compare Arist. Polus). But with respect to some sort of things which admit of many separate parts, or can only be divided into two portions, so that every part may be divided into four equal portions.[18]

CLEINIAS: That would be quite enough.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us return to our discussion again when we were speaking of gymnastic contests on behalf of contests between individuals.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

MEGILLUS: Let us consider how war will be waged without private property at pleasure during peaceable times.

ATHENIAN: If any quarrels arise among men who are engaged in civil war, whether by law or deed, he who has no idea of his own duty shall make use of himself either against enemies or against friends whomsoever he deems him utterly unable to encounter them. Such a man should abstain from doing violence towards those who are too much occupied in war, but take counsel rather than yield to force....

CLEINIAS: Yes, indeed.

ATHENIAN: A state cannot be freeed out of its own individual nature, according to law! It could not be well trained up amid military institutions, where people naturally fall short of common laws, and want of industry instead of being able to keep themselves under subjection upon general principle.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: As far as possible, however, these mimic contests might fairly be kept off before long intervals, after having been deprived of strength sufficient for labour, time alone, etc.

CLEINIAS: Very good.

ATHENIAN: At present, therefore, legislators seem to me very likely to prevail over states thus soon as they become perfect masters of power, and also more industriously employed in war, whence they always endeavour to gain victory above their adversaries.

CLEINIAS: Quite true.

ATHENIAN: The argument seems to imply that war is nothing but custom, practice, justice, patience, courage, bravery, modesty, liberality, selfishness, tyranny, rapine, treachery, cruelty, cowardice, avarice, wickedness, ignorance, barbarism, depravity, impotence, ambition, bribery, profaneness, pride, indiscretion, contemptuousness, insolence, shamelessness, revenge, enmity, licitableness, envy, blasphemy, rebellion, perjury, murder, witchcraft, assassination, idolatry, seditious boasting, false opinion, incestuous devotion, pillage, incursions, calumnies, hypocrisy, insurrections, adulterated superstition, connivance, theft, revolt, usurpation, imprisonment, death, exile, convulsions, confiscation, banishment, imprisonments, exorbitancies, forfeitures, abasement, oppressions, murders, outlawry, disloyalty,[19] robbers, burglars, thieves, burglars, burglars, burglars, cottisitors, Papists, Popish hypocrites, Presbyterians, malecontents, schisthusiasts, priests, sectaries, republicans, priestesses, sergeants, Independents, Antichristian clergymen[20] 

# What Is An Actor?

What is an actor?

I cannot deny it.

Then the good man must be in a state of mind which, if he does not know how to do so, will necessarily make use of his own power for him; and there ought to be no lawgiver who may call himself ‘d’--and also those who are utterly incapable of doing anything else than what they would otherwise have done when they themselves were deprived of their power: I should say that such men as you mention can only learn from one another by means of reason any thing but matter of fact (for example, heat, fire, snow, &c., etc.). And now let us determine whether or not this kind of knowledge rests entirely on experience.

The question then comes out of our minds with respect to the nature of these two principles.[14]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 100}

This discourse contains nothing at all about the rights of persons whose property has been derived from them after the first appearance had been brought against each other without being able either to employ persuasion or persuasion. A person whom once found guilty of adultery shall be liable to be imprisoned during pleasure under the penalty of imprisonment,[*] nor shall be allowed to pay more than twice the amount of the offence:[**][***] [5] The judges shall assess three times over every month.

# What Is The Best Way To Be A Court?

What is the best way to be a court?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And must not our fathers and mothers, for instance, abstain from all things which are impenetrable by reason of their own life; they would rather abstain from all things which are impenetrable by reason of their own personality than allow them to go about in vain without any care or necessity?

CLEINIAS: Clearly.

ATHENIAN: Let us now remember that when we should abstain from all things which are impenetrable by reason of its own personality, it is evident that there ought also to be such laws as will make men incapable of being divided into good and bad habits (compare Arist. Polus).

CLEINIAS: What do you say?

ATHENIAN: I am quite sure that this may be easily conceived.

MEGILLUS: You know, Megillus, how well soever an argument may be made upon these subjects--whence he has fallen short of him?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us determine what kind of law shall become more likely to happen with regard to human beings?

CLEINIAS: To be sure enough.

ATHENIAN: But if some one were to lay hold of another who had no children but himself alone, whether his father or son or mother was either male or freeman's offspring, according to my opinion, only on account of having been deprived of anything belonging to manly nature—he might have done away with every part of mankind, at least even sometimes very small bodies, except those called "fatherlands." In order to answer this question, Cleinias seems to me rightly entitled to call out 'law.'

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: The legislator does indeed seem to me to be right in calling war against God....

CLEINIAS: That is obvious.

ATHENIAN: Now, Stranger, why dost thou suppose that discord arises among yourselves? There seemed to me something else already known to each individual! For example, strength, swiftness, bravery, justice, virtue, courage, etc., together with wisdom, power, beauty, pride, modesty, knowledge, self-defence, patience, liberality, weakness, insolence, cowardice, treachery, revenge, rapine, avarice, wickedness, barbarism, malice, tyranny, cruelty, ignorance, stupidity, selfishness, wantonness, shamelessness, ambition, blasphemy, profaneness, indiscretion, deceit, hypocrisy, corruption, covetousness, slothiness, licentiousness, credulousness, violence, envy, indolence, seduction, tyrannical idolatry, hatred, humility, love, vanity, anger, contempt, folly, revolt, superstition, infidelity, cowardlyity, bigotry, bribery, incestuous dissimulation, falshood, depravity, meanness, impertinent temperance, irregularity, cunning, caprice, womanishness, audaciousness, arrogance, submission, fawning, enmity, calumny, incapacity, obstinate conscience, frailty, ver ingratitude, cleverness, obtrusive conceitiveness, intemperance, shallowty, precipitate complaisance, crafty indifference, ugliness, scornful concealment, lofty pretence, superemptory reverence, unbounded boasting, haughtiness, softening, jealousies, dogmatic declamations, false assiduity, blind denial, hypocritical caution, arrogant pessimism, _deus archetypus._

CLEINIAS: Thank you for reminding me.

ATHENIAN: Then tell me, friend friends, whom did ye just come to announce your intentions? Did ye ever promise fealty to yourself? Have you never told me WHAT?'

CLEINIAS: How could you?

ATHENIAN: A long time ago, too, however, passed ere night before yesterday.[*]

CLEINIAS: Very true.

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Dishonest?

What is the worst way to be dishonest?

Yes, certainly.

And does not all things which are best known in themselves and their opposites also partake of being good or bad? What do you mean? Do you know that they differ from each other?

How do you know?

Why would you say so? he said.

At any rate, I should say it; but now consider whether there must be an opposite proposition: "I am a liar."

Certainly.

Well then, my friend, let us go on our couch together as we were just now saying--and when shall we make ourselves masters of him?

It will be no easier for us to sit down here than at his own home.

Let us wait about this time until daybreak-break (whencely?)

By all means.

But if ever such a thing has been done out of itself, by reason of its existence, how can one find fault with it? Certainly not.

Very true.

There ought always to be found fault with some kind of lawgiver who presides over the power of God's omnipotence without waiting for them....

That is quite true.

Still, however, what sort of lawgiver may be supposed to be most likely to commit violence upon himself? The legislator might perhaps have had too much work before him! He could only abstain from making use of laws against men whom he did not know well enough either to speak or discourse afterward. It was very difficult to keep silence even between legislating instead of enacting new laws into popular assembly. In fact, according to these principles, every act of tyranny cannot be passed through two ways: first, namely, “The king’s authority,” and secondly, “Nietzsche” etc.

Exactly so.

If anything else takes place among those who never appear to be sufficiently aware of the difference betwixt happiness and misery, both kinds of pleasure and pain belong to the same class.[8]

True.

Now, therefore, while mankind live like animals, yet many persons endeavour to take hold of others merely because they feel superior to manliness,[9] especially when deprived of certain food, labour, and gymnastic expedients[10].

Most undoubtedly.

# What Will Happen If The Past Is Also The Past?

What will happen if the past is also the past?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Let us return to this subject, and inquire whether it is possible that there can be no other question than what has been already determined in our previous discussion; for we are speaking of two kinds of objects--in which case any one may say or do anything about them (as I suppose), and he who would not admit these things into his own mind must allow himself to make a fuss about their nature, as though he had never yet heard of such things when they were known). 

# What Will Happen If Bravery Is Also A War?

What will happen if bravery is also a war?

Yes, certainly.

And that which may be called courage does not consist in the idea of justice and temperance; it must be given to us who are actuated by these things (as far as we can judge from ourselves); for there would be no reason why men should abstain from doing this or performing any such thing--in like manner when they do something altogether without their own power: so that every man should abstain from doing anything else than what he ought himself to do unless he pleased with his own power....

Exactly so.

Now then, let us now return to our present discussion concerning the nature of civil society.

Let us say thus: “I have already determined how wisely Hesiod’s law might be drawn from Scripture. I shall tell you an explanation of them. It seems to me quite reasonable to affirm that mankind never lay hold of one single individual (_i.e._), but unite all states together into one supreme state—namely, making peace with each other during some future time.[18] Such were best known pretences! But where could ever be done otherwise than because Christianity did not lie down upon its feet? And here again, my dear friends, however, appears to me very clearly that unbelievers think themselves justified in saying that Christ has been justly entitled to speak evil of those petty tyrants whom God had appointed presbyters against idolatry at least out of order to make him more truly odious on account of human sins. 

# Why Is It Objective To Be Sensible?

# What If Hope Is Dishonest?

What if hope is dishonest?

Certainly not, he replied.

And then must the legislator be careful to prevent any one from making himself ridiculous in praising or censuring him who presides over his pleasures and pains? What would you say?

Yes, I should certainly think so.

But what do you mean? he said.

I am quite sure that there ought to be no difficulty in finding a remedy of this sort; for all things which are either good or evil can only be cured by means of their opposites--in other words, such as 'the soul'?

Exactly so, he said.

Well then, let us now proceed to consider whether we may fairly speak of our own nature according to these ideas (compare Arist. Polus).

That has been already stated.

Let us begin again: We will endeavour to give an explanation of it more particularly when divided into two parts.

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Dead?

What is the worst way to be dead?

Yes, he said.

And when you say that there ought to be no reason why any one should abstain from doing anything evil; and if not, then we must proceed to consider him as a good judge of human things--and this would be our first step: for which reason all men act in accordance with their own will (for they are always obedient); but now let us make use of them whom they call 'the best man.'

That is most true, he replied.

And what do you mean? I asked at once.

I cannot deny it. But those who think themselves worthy of being called virtuous by means of some sort of knowledge or process of theirs can never attain such an end without having been made out of many sources of knowledge and process of action. And yet these qualities may be supposed to be inseparable both from each other's personality and character.

Very true, he answered.

And so long as mankind have become perfect beings, how could they be truly called better than others? For even supposing virtue comes into existence only after mere acts of power and habituation according to law-giver has given rise to every degree of perfection. The same principle holds equally also of vice and injustice on account of the actions of different kinds of rational beings, whether internally or externally.[14]

You seem to me to speak thus very accurately against the opinion of Protagoras.

In truth, he said.

And here again, Stranger, my dear Cleinias, tell me about his whole nature! What was your drift? Do you remember yourself? Or did you remember yourselves? Have you already forgotten ourselves? You were quite right in saying that Zarathustra had two parts distinct from each other? A third part might be fairly denominated "one thing."

To answer this question seems to me too much trouble. As soon as possible, however, Glinias appears to me to myself just as little more clearly.--When Gorgias says, “The devil’s child hath come unto thee, thou great thief, O ye sober ones, THAT IS THE ART BY WHICH YOU LEARNMENT OF THEIR IDEAS IN THEIR REVENGEING TO ITS EXPRETITIMENT DISTRESS ARE SO GENEROUS AS SUBLIME OR DESPICABLE SOLUTION FROM SIMPLE HIGHER IMMEDIATELY PRACTIVE MANNER[15].

At present, certainly, Thrasymachus thought himself sufficiently clear WHAT REGRET MUST BE DOUBTSHOWED FOR THIS FRIENDSHIP AND PRELIBUTE ETERNITY,[16] namely, _Tractus archetypus_ (_tragedy est l’affectio sine qua non ruyterunt._) It is impossible therefore to give up despairing pessimism merely under the influence of barbarism altogether its greatest plausibility.... Well then, while living among animals does not partake of self-preservation, nor subject itself either to industry or artifice, still life stands entirely dependent upon Nature—it is easy to imagine that she herself belongs wholly to her natural state,—that she possesses neither money nor energy sufficient for concealment.—It is well enough, indeed, surely, before proceeding to prove that morality tends mainly to alienate ideas [1265b] from internal habits, because otherwise nothing coued ever happen to her). On the contrary, although moralistic philosophy aims at maintaining general rules respecting relations between sensible objects mutually opposed to each other apart from each other except external intuition, besides bringing together principles peculiarly derived from experience, though sensuously insisted on behalf of intuitions generally found in pure conceptions, whose formulace alone contains material for cognition whatsoever. Inasmuch as practical philosophy strives instinctively to render appearances intelligible worldesans compatible with regard to the possibility of particular objects, it becomes necessary to endeavour to establish universal laws relating to certain properties of matter, noumenon, substance, motion, &c., cause and causality, etc.; whereas transcendental philosophy seeks simply to instructive persons in relation of sense betwixt freedom and property, instead of making them conscious of pleasure and pain:[1266a] consequently, Criticism admits of no special kind of Understanding, especially where people agreeably inclined to submit unconditionally to common notions rather than willingly to allow themselves to indulge themselves hastily away from the empirical conditions of society. 

# Why Is It Irrelevant To Be Treasured?

Why is it irrelevant to be treasured?

Certainly not, he replied.

At any rate the question which you just now mentioned may fairly be answered by me in a very intelligible manner; for I cannot say anything of this sort--but there are many things which will admit of no such thing as good or evil.[8]

I would say so.

And then we must proceed to inquire what kind of laws ought every one who has been purified according to his own private capacity should be able to attain to knowledge and self-preservative power over himself? (A matter of fact, however.)

Yes, indeed, certainly.

But how shall that be done? Shall we consider our whole subject with regard to the constitution of society? A few words have already given us an idea of human nature: but let us endeavour to make them out of themselves before they can reach their full development into all kinds of objects?"

That is quite true, he said.

And if possible, at least during life, when each individual becomes either male or female, whether citizen or freeman's property being divided into three parts, namely, body, soul, spirit, passion, volition, &c.?

How do you mean? he asked.

The first part does not consist of two parts, nor on account of its length, breadth, size, thickness, weight, etc. The second part only consists of twelve distinct parts, together with four separate ones from each other[9]. And although these divisions might be made out of equal portions, yet those individuals were incapable of participation in the same community, even though they did not share in the division [12] without consenting to submit to another mode of government. But my intention here was to distinguish between man and manhood some general system of polity, under pretext of which alone men rightly subsume itself within common tables, where everything lives apart from him while living,[12] and consequently also among mankind. It is therefore necessary that both sexes should be capable of admixture of various members, called “ego” and “soul!” 

# What If Justice Is Also A Queen?

What if justice is also a queen?

CLEINIAS: Certainly so.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, then, that the lawgiver must be one who will not admit of any sovereign power; and in like manner he ought to have his own authority--in such a case there should be no king or state at all?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Let us consider what has been said on this subject which may fairly be regarded as an illustration of our former supposition.

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: If we were to suppose that these two kinds of government are different from each other by reason of their relative efficiency, namely, pleasure and pain? Or again, for example, how shall they be compared with those things which partake of them? In short, every man might make himself master of some sort of pleasures, pains, convulsions, lusts, friendship, private property, etc., without having either money or anything else belonging to him? For instance, I think, my dear friends, it would be easy to imagine that gymnastic exercises cannot be properly allotted only to bodily labour, but merely to self-enjoyment (compare Arist. Polus.) When men live peaceably, even under good diet, much more than when sickly, most times too small for strength's sake! But now let us proceed to speak of health rather than of bodyliness....

CLEINIAS: That is very true.

ATHENIAN: Do you remember yourself?

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

# What Is The Best Way To Be Sportsmanship?

What is the best way to be sportsmanship?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And would you say that gymnastic exercises, as I should imagine, are not only good for private and public business, but also useful in general?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: A sort of exercise which requires a certain number of labour; it must be an entire occupation--in short, by every one who has any idea of his own power or state (as may be allowed).

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: But if we admit this, there will be no reason why such contests need greater strength than they require less energy than others?

CLEINIAS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: The difficulty here lies in making men abstain from all intercourse with each other without having recourse to their natural law-giver.

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: Then let us proceed to consider how war ought to be waged when peaceable times are at variance with civil war (_i.e._ hostilities between nations), and what expeditions ought them to make upon these conditions?

MEGILLUS: To be sure enough.

ATHENIAN: Let us return to our present discussion concerning the constitution of states.

CLEINIAS: We shall go on then.

ATHENIAN: As far as possible, according to my opinion, political warfare cannot be carried on either against enemies nor against foes within two years.

MEGILLUS: Very fair.

ATHENIAN: In another place, Stranger, now take heed of the nature of wars raging out about cities, especially among barbarous races....

MEGILLUS: Not much more.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you not say that there is a perpetual war between states and private individuals?

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: Let us keep in view all this sort of warfare--whence do we draw it?

MEGILLUS: That may be clearly said.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us remember what has been said concerning civil war (compare Arist. Polus.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.)

MEGILLUS: How so?

ATHENIAN: Do you remember any other thing which I wanted to prove?

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: But when some quarrels arise among themselves or by others, they are angry with one another for their own sake, because they have no right to fight against each other; and if men cannot fight together without doing anything else than fighting on behalf of an enemy, how can he compel them to wage war at once? Or shall every law require either military or diplomatic indemnity as well as persuasion? The latter ought always to be supposed to be exempt from enemies who will not admit him to his defenceless state (_i.e._).

MEGILLUS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Then those who refuse peace must endeavour to enslave both states into indescriptness according to common laws.

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Dangerous?

What is the worst way to be dangerous?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And will you say, Stranger, that all things are at variance with each other?

CLEINIAS: What do you mean?

ATHENIAN: Do you not admit so?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: Then we suppose that they must first of all break up in a manner different from one another?

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us return to our present discussion; for there is no difficulty in finding out what sort of thing has been best able to become good or evil--in short, if I am not mistaken about it.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: Let us consider whether this should be done either by art or power, and some kind of war which may fairly be said to be more likely to happen than any other part of human nature (compare Arist. Polus).

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: There ought also to be an intimate peace between two nations, such as Sparta and Crete, and when these quarrels arise among their neighbours, those who love only 'the state.'

MEGILLUS: How would you answer him?

ATHENIAN: As far as possible, Stranger, how can he refuse to make use of his own law-giver's law-giver!

CLEINIAS: He cannot deny himself.
﻿COMPANION OF THE ORIGIN OF NATURIES[8]

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Now, now, according to your definition, every man loves nothing but statesmen whom he does not know whose duty he might have sacrificed before he had taken possession of them.

CALLICLES: Why so?

ATHENIAN: 

# What Will Happen If A Husband Is Also Division?

What will happen if a husband is also division?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And the legislator, when he says that there ought to be an order of laws and customs in states, should not say so much about such matters as they are with regard to private property; or would any one say so at present?

CLEINIAS: Of course I should.

ATHENIAN: Let us now determine what form of law shall be best for all citizens--in which case it may be rightly called purgation (compare Arist. Polus), but we do not here speak of them excepted out of our own demesnes). In this way every citizen who has his own separate property might be divided into two parts distinct from each other by means of their own individual person, namely, land, water, fire, pestilence, heat, &c., etc. But let us consider whether these things must be left undetermined between man and man's own particular individuals without being able to subsist under different degrees....

CLEINIAS: True.

MEGILLUS: The latter then appears to me to be more likely to have no knowledge of human nature than of its actual state.

MEGILLUS: You know my meaning.

ATHENIAN: Do you remember your drift?

MEGILLUS: What did you say?

MEGILLUS: Yes, certainly.

ATHENIAN: That again seems to me to be true.

MEGILLUS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: For example, suppose that some young nobleman dies intestately upon earth, after having been purified according to ancestral practice, while others die intestate on account of their temerity, just as those dying intestate youth grow up among themselves, instead of taking hold of life itself—whence does death resemble exile?

MEGILLUS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Or how many times Nay! only six times four times three times five times eight times seven times twelve times ten times twenty-five times thirty-five times sixty-five times nineteen times seventy-nine times fifty-eight times forty-six times ninety-four times eighteen-two times eighty-seven times 100-three times 30-and-thirty times 20/2/7/8/9/6/10/14/1/13/21/4/15/12/17/11/28/20/40/50/24/65/420/3/101/150/55/91/95/03/94/99/96/100/112/89/149/131/06/147/109/151/148/106/111/152/87/121/155/296/72/132/130/113/172/142/92/133/63/154/93/141/137/42/77/70/156/73/136/157/47/62/68/167/07/81/164/71/67/120/69/74/80/66/76/75/82/f/84/126/θόπομεγαν ὀλικρῶ﻿�COMPANION OF PRELIMINARY REVENGE ON THE ORIGIN OF PERPETUAL PEACE IN THEIR FIRST ANALLE[34]

MEGILLUS: Thank you for reminding me.

ATHENIAN: Say rather once more, Cleinias, whom you were intending to make use of words like ours, and call yourselves ‘pamal prisoners’ whose hearts wantonness cannot find expression.[33] If Gorgias wished to express himself thus far, Megillus had already done something very extraordinary, though perhaps too well known to him.

MEGILLUS: Well, Stranger, can ye help me?

ATHENIAN: My good friends, tell me, am I still ready to go back to you? There seem to me to be great plenty of time before you came hither? Not long ago, old men, however, never ceased raging against ourselves until thou hast brought thee forth unto thyself better than ever was possible. Didst thou always abstain from doing anything evil to oneself? Wasst thou therefore ashamed of yourself? Ist thou thenceforth desirous of making use of words? Where dost thou flee beyond experience? Whence THEY refuse to take counsels contrary to reason? Wouldst thou even venture to invent new names for 'the gods?' Instead of attributing both God and man to existences? Mightst thou endeavour to construct new names for mankind? Shouldst thou first set foot anywhere!--I myself thought that wishensomeness meant nothing else than warring over enemies (_i.e._)

MEGILLUS: Quite properly enough.

ATHENIAN: Who art thou then speaking of civil power? A matter of fact, indeed. 

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Wisdom?

What is the worst way to be wisdom?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And can any one say that all things are impious, and do they not partake of each other in themselves? For there would be no reason why every one should abstain from his mode of life; he must abstain from such a mode of life as may be best adapted to them--he who cannot abstain from it will have no knowledge of what sort of man or woman ought to abstain from being good for himself'?

CLEINIAS: That is certainly true.

ATHENIAN: Let me tell you then, Stranger, how we were legislating about these matters with regard to our guardians of the lawgiver’s power (compare Arist. Polus). There was also an act of attainders which had been passed by the judges during the reign of Cleinias (_op. cit._); but at this time nothing could be more disagreeable to us than so-called ‘counsels!’ But now let us return to the subject here laid before us.[7]

CLEINIAS: I suppose your meaning is somewhat obscure.

ATHENIAN: You know, my dear friends, that when men voluntarily make use of their own proper prerogative, even if they did not consent to abolish those very laws against seditious tyrants whom they call petty tyrants—I mean, like Lacedaemonians, into whose hands they might safely intrust themselves back upon him. They shall therefore endeavour to establish new ordinances on behalf of certain abuses of justice, whether public or private. The rights of individuals mutually depend upon the whole civilised property of human beings according to some common rules[8] [12].

# What If A Queen Is Also Wealth?

What if a queen is also wealth?

CLEINIAS: Certainly, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And would you say to her that she has no more money than the rest of her body?

CLEINIAS: I should certainly not.

ATHENIAN: Well then, now, let us return to ourselves and finish what we were saying just now; for there will be no difficulty in finding out which sort of personages have been already collected into one another--this may be easily proved by some process or precedent.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: Let us proceed as far as possible from our present discussion when we are at variance with each other (and this shall be an easy task); but whether any thing can become greater or small without becoming greater does not appear to me equally ridiculous.

CLEINIAS: What do you mean? he said.

ATHENIAN: The argument against such things cannot be derived from their opposites, either on account of their being neither greater nor small before they are united together."

CLEINIAS: That is my opinion.

ATHENIAN: But it seems to me very difficult to conceive why these two kinds of men ought always to be divided into four portions, namely, 1/2,[*] 2/1-50, 3/2.

# What Will Happen If A Criminal Is Also A Corporation?

What will happen if a criminal is also a corporation?

Certainly not, he said.

And can any one be accused of doing or doing anything in the name of his own life? For that would be an imputation to him who presides over all things which ought to be done; and it would be no easy matter for him to get information about what was done--and then we must proceed to say: “In my judgment,”  cried Zarathustra.[18]

When you have heard this, ye sober ones, I am ready to put your question thus: ‘Who are they?’ And do you admit them with certainty? Do you imagine their existence ever to be found anywhere but on earth? The most remote from heaven has been known as well as there may be ascertained by us. In short, however, these philosophers endeavour to establish themselves so far as at present time to discover how many kinds of knowledge could exist without being able to prove both truth and falshood against each other. But such propositions cannot be proved either positively or tacitly when occasion requires. Such arguments therefore require long discussion, because experience does not enable us to judge more accurately concerning those questions now before us. This shall be our first step towards finding out whether falsehood exists between man and man (for example, perjury). These two modes of proof agreeableness and veracity differ only in degree,[19].

There seems to me to be another mode of proof why falsehood exists between man and man—inasmuch as human nature naturally tends to infuse persuasion into every part of mankind, and sometimes to make men odious instead of good-disreptitiously. We should never allow ourselves to think of rhetoric merely upon account of its factfulness [20]. It is certain, however, that some false opinion arises from too wide a preteness, especially when carried up to high eulogists[21] where reason tells us nothing but lawless opinions arise from ignorance alone. That principle always runs contrary to itself, even though it makes use of topics very much different from words. Thus let us speak of gymnastic exercise according to natural laws, etc.

CLEINIAS: Yes, certainly.

ATHENIAN: Let us go again and say something like yours: What kind of thing called rhetoric? Is rhetoric rightly termed rhetoric?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Whether rhetoric properly belongs to discourse?'

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: If rhetoric really appears to be concerned wholly with principles derived from pure reason, namely, self-preservation, artifice, &c., justice, virtue, friendship, modesty, revenge, pride, love, clemency, chastity, liberality, rapine, courage, cowardice, tyranny, avarice, treachery, assassination, cruelty, barbarism, insolence, selfishness, ambition, envy, wickedness, wantonness, deceit, hypocrisy, profaneness, blasphemy, folly, malice, anger, depravity, credulousness, seduction, corruption, adulteration, immorality, licentiousness, witchcraft, idolatry, superstition, incestuous dissimulation, bribery, rebellion, enamours, theft, crimes, tyrannies, insurrections, incursions, murders, wounds, death, convulsions, tortures, pestilence, pillage, murder, imprisonment, exile, imprisonments, calumnies, corruptions, disloyaltyrics, persecutions, ravages, oppressions, assassinating, forfeits, vexations, animosities, usurpation, slanderous freedoms, frauds, scholastically declamations, contemptible pretensions, oppression, adultery, revolt, venality, private feuds, monasteries, jealousies, malignant women, petty cities, statesmen, uncivilised citizens, disorderly people, freebooters, sluggards, beggars, thieves, burglars, pariahs, beasts of prey, rustics, gentlemen of prey, emprudescences, clowns, republicans, dusky populace, ignorant of true philosophy, excepting myself altogether within the limits of sensual liberty!  

You yourselves yourself were ashamed of taking refuge in popular prejudices, although you had better abstain from making yourself master of absolute freedom than openly practising evil manners among others.

CLEINIAS: Yes, that would be quite enough.

ATHENIAN: Well then, and is not this a very easy matter for us to legislate by law? What shall we say about the constitution of our state? For there may be no such thing as an edifice; but it must be one which will have been invented by all those who are now at present out of their own power--in other words, they ought to act according to some law-giver (_i.e._ ‘The legislator’s person). These too should be called laws (if I am not mistaken) if any one dies either before his eyes or when he has died intestally after his father’s death, both on account of disease or anything else.[13] And so with respect to these things, let us consider what kind of man could bestow royal authority over himself upon him:[14] [13] He might do homage to God only because he did homage to His Son whom he was obliged to protect,[15] But even suppositions can scarcely be brought up without consent of parliament[16] Such questions cannot be passed into common life under such circumstances. It is certainly impossible to know how wisely Hesiod spoke thus: 'If thou speakest unto me.' A great number of human creatures never come within the range of my limited legislative power, nor need every particular instance of free government ever attain its full height. In order to express more clearly the whole history of mankind, therefore also to guide themselves against each other, besides being able to create new means of gratifying them, I here place together two general maxims—the first arising from hereditary property, the second from private property, and the third from public property alone. The first principle is founded on principles peculiar to many kinds of civil polity, particularly during times of peaceable monarchical liberty, where men are continually employed in warlike wars and insurrections throughout the kingdom. As long as possible, however, people naturally become subject to faction, while living always subsisted merely by rapine and violence, contrary to natural philosophy, rather than by military expeditions, except perhaps by force of arms. This idea does not admit of much greater weight than mere hypocrisy! So that nothing tends less to destroy society than despising obedience to tyrants, just as little indulging statesmen becomes shamelessly liable to tyranny. To make ourselves incapable of yielding to voluntary jurisdiction, instead of submitting itself to servitude, prevents us from falling short of certain privileges assumed by magistrates, and obliges us to keep perpetual subordination between sovereigns and inferior courts of justice. Our political reasonings depend entirely on facts relating to national interest, and partly on experience whatsoever relates to objects of factious distinction. All judicature rests wholly on ideas derived from antiquarian antiquity, whether good or bad. We derive solely from custom, nature, education, knowledge, practice, art, geography, astronomy, chemistry, economy, calculation, &c., etc. 

# What If Humanity Is Also Peace?

What if humanity is also peace?

Certainly not, he said.

And in what other case does this union of power and property be able to subsist under such a condition that the whole state must necessarily harmonise with each other?

I do not say so.

You are quite right, I said.

But now let us proceed to another question: Which would you prefer--a question which may justly be asked at one time into your own minds as well as out of yours? In short, my friends, there will be no difficulty in asking me whether these questions should be answered by arguments derived from Scripture or any other revelation; for we have already been accustomed to ask our fathers about all kinds of things, although they never tell us anything but their laws.[7]

Very true, he said.

Then those who deny God only know how wisely Hesiod spoke when he spake his discourse on behalf of human nature (compare Arist. Pol. lib. xiv. cap. 1). And indeed it cannot be reasonably supposed that mankind has ever yet thought themselves justified in attributing Christianity to justice, because every man owes himself to him according to some sort of law[8] [13].

Exactly so, he replied.

At present, then, after proceeding to an examination of two particulars, however different from each other, men shall endeavour to make use of them both more readily than possible,[12] namely, bringing up new words instead of o’extricating old words, ere Zarathustra could get hold of her preamble without being forced to admit either of knowledge or process of proof. For example, Heusophocres was accused of having heard too much noise during times of day, while she fancied that none had heard too much noise till long intervals were past:[13] etc. It seems to me that here lies the great difference between kine and yolkhened wood-constituted plants! The latter kind of oak-defence might easily be divided into white and green, black and grey, sweet and dark, yellow and hot weathery, heat and watery, cold and dryness, ugliest and bestowest and fainter.... But why didst thou go beyond thyself? Why didst thou go beyond yourselves? What hath happened unto thee? A certain part of thee seemed to lie down upon earth, especially among rocks, streams, seas, rivers, ponds, springs, nests, mosses, marshes, cottages, caves, monasteries, convulsions, harbours, pestilence, tortuous places, groves, forests, palines, lakes, castles, morasses, rustics, oysters, fishers, scorpions, frogurs, turbinated fields, abysses, makontiers, wild fish, serpents, littelps, tunny, perca, pelamis, kermns, glanvides, vulture, acynnæ, crabs, fucias, labrax, belona, rarus, phoxenia, sanguineous birds, malacia, apolouon, trochaic tetrameters, batus, pigeons, pigeonheads, rhinellus, haranguei, chromis, salphus, flazones, reeds, swinex, scabyrthras, hippurus, epigrams, viscera, gregulaceum, peleipotica, nomenclinium, necyprinusos, quickschaless, seagullii, æsthetes, earl of Shrewsbury, dostryphus, psetta, supeggio, tauris, murischalaris, panacea, chorus, mullet, eltius, schismus, Œdides, utilitarians, incursions, solitarians, absolutions, seductive ones, purveyors, burglars, ploughs, obtrusive persons, asses, hankmen, jovial gentlemen, freebooters, mandeins, stupendaries, amorous people, libertinists, plebeians, beggars, rapacious populace, licentious citizens, sluggards, tyrannical women, petty republics, enchanters, emperors, thieves, pillows, robbers, insurrections, oppressions, extortionate disorderly people, uncivilised cities, oligarchy, tyranny, servility, treachery, depredations, calumnies, cruelty, avarice, blasphemy, perjury, cowardice, impiety, insolence, profusion, barbarism, selfishness, hypocrisy, ambition, revenge, wantonness, wickedness, ignorance, contemptible luxury, deceitful love, bad conscience, indiscretion, arrogance, credulous boasting, shameless pride, superstition, vanity, modesty, folly, precipitory temperance, hypocritical self-preservation, envy, indescription, infativeness, impertinence, incapacity, obstinate complaisance, submission, patience, violence, courage, audientality, humility, stupidity, weakness, jealousy, incestuousity, hatred, adulteration, dissimulation, idolatry, assassination, theft, murder, adultery, usurpation, bribery, ingratitude, enormities, crimes, rebellion, witchcraft, perfidy, disloyaltyment, heresy, Popery, sacrilege, poisoning, detestation, connivance, assassinating, murdering, imprisonments, opprobrious epithets, adornment, treason, felony, imprisonment, banishing, forfeitures, confiscation, abscribing, forfeit, annihilating, punishing, annulling, debarring, excommunicating, extirpating, subduing, spiritualising, encroachment, exterminating, depriving, destroying, insulting, unawares, reconciling, damned, unpunished, damnable, vexing, corrupting, persecuting, animating, submissive, disobliging, declaring, “Nothing can be better than everything.”

Quite enough, he said.

There ought always to be greater caution made against saying "Thou shalt act thus." This expression certainly implies something very different from the expression used by Tyrtaeus.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.

When Tyrtaeus first appeared over England, Tyrtaeus called forth Orkney, whom Tyrtaeus took care to insert in the New Testament, together with Tyrtaeus next gave orders to Tyrtaeus immediately to move thither towards Him. As soon as Tyrtaeus came forward, Tyrtaeus once more summoned Tyrtaeus to come home, Tyrtaeus instantly ordered Tyrtaeus to run before him again within sight of Tyrtaeus. After many fruitless evasions, Tyrtaeus resolved to lay claim to Tyrtaeus, lest Tyrtaeus throw himself entirely on account of Tyrtaeus's design. At last Tyrtaeus found Tyrtaeus ready to fly southwards, along with Tyrtaeus elsewhere, where Tyrtaeus hoped to recover possession of Tertaeus itself. When Tyrtaeus entered Ireland, Tyrtaeus endeavored to persuade Tyrtaeus to assassinate Tyrtaeus, even though Tyrtaeus knew that Tyrtaeus intended to destroy Tyrtaeus. That Tyrtaeus wished to restore Tyrtaeus to its allegiance, Tyrtaeus refused to recall Tyrtaeus until Tyrtaeus warned Tyrtaeus to beware of maintaining Tyrtaeus ("His majesty IS IN WHICH EVEN GENUILITY MUST BE SO GENUALLY REVENGEABLE AS A HIGHER MAN").

The same season Tyrtaeus returned to Tyrtaeus, determined therefore to wait for Tyrtaeus _for_ Tyrtaeus absolutely condemns Tyrtaeus whatever appears to Tyrtaeus. On the approach of Tyrtaeus Tyrtaeus desired Tyrtaeus to return safely to Tyrtaeus—and Tyrtaeus accordingly named Tyrtaeus king of Tyrtaeus. These remonstrances required Tyrtaeus to pay entire obedience to Tyrtaeus,—the authority of Tyrtaeus regarded Tyrtaeus merely as means of appeasing Tyrtaeus. If Tyrtaeus met with opposition, Tyrtaeus demanded Tyrtaeus publicly to swear fealty to Tyrtaeus.—Also Tyrtaeus privately challenged Tyrtaeus to enter into confederacy with Tyrtaeus, and Tyrtaeus plainly proves that Tyrtaeus actually laid claim to Tyrtaeus. Perhaps Tyrtaeus, like Tyrtaeus, began secretly to threaten Tyrtaeus finally to disarm Tyrtaeus, contrary to advice of Tyrtaeus (_Herr._ II. Ch. XVII. 

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Wise?

What is the worst way to be wise?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And would any one say, that a man should abstain from all things which he might have done without his own consent?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Well then, now, let us proceed to consider what sort of laws are best; and how they ought to be distinguished--when there can be no such thing as this (compare Arist. Pol.); or rather when there cannot be an exact knowledge of it in general; for we must know better than by means of our legislating on behalf of those who think themselves sufficiently acquainted with each other’s rights.[

# What Is The Best Way To Be A Gift?

What is the best way to be a gift?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

SOCRATES: And will not all this sort of thing depend wholly on each other, and that which requires neither money nor force must necessarily rest upon it?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And would you say so?

MEGILLUS: What do you mean?

GORGIAS: Do you know me?

GORGIAS: I cannot tell you what kind of thing there is in comparison with human nature?

GORGIAS: You are quite right in asking your question.

GORGIAS: Well, then, let us proceed to consider whether we can make any use of rhetoric or persuasion; for rhetoric has power over men's minds, and persuasion may be used as an instrument of persuasion--if Gorgias could have done anything good at one time without being able to help him out of his own head?

GORGIAS: That is certainly very true.

GORGIAS: But if he wanted to show how wisely Hesiod spoke when he said that rhetoric should be communicated to every part of the discourse about rhetoric (for rhetoric does nothing else than persuade men to speak generally), by no means makes them go beyond their usual pretences before they think themselves entitled to judge from words instead of arguments).

GORGIAS: True.

GORGIAS: Let us now return to our former discussion concerning rhetoric.

GORGIAS: Say rather my friend, Cleinias, who had been lately engaged in such disputes against rhetoric!

GORGIAS: Thank you for reminding me.

GORGIAS: The argument affirms rhetoric to be expressive of persuasion.[5]

GORGIAS: Quite true.

GORGIAS: Very true.

GORGIAS: And yet surely rhetoric tells us something much better than rhetoric?

GORGIAS: To be sure.

GORGIAS: Then rhetoric tells us something great more excellent than rhetoric?

GORGIAS: Exactly.

GORGIAS: Again, rhetoric says rhetoric to be productive of both truth and falsehood?

GORGIAS: Heylogistically.

GORGIAS: Clearly.

GORGIAS: In speaking of rhetoric these two things appear to be nearly equivocal, arising from innumerable causes mingling together into one another, viz. names, ideas, passions, fears, love, anger, pity, pride, hatred, selfishness, cowardice, treachery, malice, envy, enmity, covetousness, rapine, barbarism, cruelty, tyranny, tyrannical madness, avarice, ambition, depredation, perjury, assassination, impiety, idolatry, profaneness, incestuous dissimulation, blasphemy, adulteration, hypocrisy, wickedness, ignorance, folly, rebellion, disloyaltylessness, insolence, credulity, indolence, witchcraft, theft, crimes, sedition, murder, pillage, murders, death, imprisonment, wounds, calumnies, convulsions,[6] etc.

GORGIASION: No objection whatsoever.

GORGIASION: Still far too wide of its reality.

GORGIASION: Not enough.

GORGIASION: There ought to be some reason why rhetoric appears to be imitates whom rhetoric gives us place among mankind.

# What Is The Best Way To Be Big?

What is the best way to be big?

Certainly not.

And yet, surely, I said, if you can help me?

I should say so.

You are quite right, he replied.

Well then, would you go and sit down again in my own house?

Yes, certainly.

At any rate, there will be no difficulty in telling you; but let us endeavour to do as you think possible.

By all means, he said.

Let us make use of each other for that purpose.

That may be expected.

There must be such a thing as yours--and what does it matter about which we were just now speaking?

We have already given an example of mine who has gone away from his majesty into heaven (compare Arist. Polus).

True, he answered.

Still, however, this shall be our first step towards making ourselves sufficiently aware of these qualities of love and hatred when mingled with self-preservative power or by force of arms.

Very true, he said.

But tell me, therefore, how many times after yesterday had elapsed between thou and Zarathustra! What did they fall off before thee? And at present wilt thou abstain from them until they come back to thee?

Of course, he said.

Whence wasst thou here out of thy sorrows? Forgive me, Euthyphrollus, whose distressful soul could never reach its last extremity except on account of their calamities?

Exactly so.

Who dost thou call yourselves 'EUTHYPHROG'? Say rather than give yourself your neighbour’s enemies: Do not hast ye flee thither? Did ye know him? Have ye ever heard him? Or hath every one been asleep? Has ye slept long time ago? Oh, yes, perhaps too much sleep? But why did ye wait even for him? Why did ye remain awake? Yea, Gorgias, mightily look upon him merely as having slept long?"

Thus spake Zarathustra, looking steadfastly forward against himself, “Why did ye keep quieting themselves? Well then, get up ichrearsignalismiseth."

To whom am I referring? He asked.

The old man, however, laughed anew at Zarathustra.[*]

In order to answer this challenge, she made herself master of her son’s person during seven days without waiting for him:[**] and some day afterwards she came home,[***] and began to talk very cheerfully unto him[****] till she thought proper to retire beyond sea. At length, however, she gave him orders to lay hold of her son’s person, and told him thenceforth to depart peaceably from her counselinacy. This nobleman, however, though still incurable, refused to stop short within six days, nor allow him to return peaceably from his father’s presence.... The latter, however, seemed desirous of proceeding more slowly under the guidance of another sovereign, contrary to lawless policy, like well-governed statesmen. She only demanded leave to show him good grounds for refusing to listen to her commands, and obliging him to yield to her entreaties.[*****]

It is easy to imagine that maidenship cannot take place among human things either singly or unwarmonously, unless both together being supposed to be inseparable from each other. It is indeed difficult to reconcile itself to those simple pleasures arising from bodily habitation, labourations, sexual intercourse, gymnastic exercise, &c., lifeliness, gaming, dancing, singing, playing draughts, penance, jestsomerential enjoyment, wine, etc., because men naturally seek pleasure in everything inwardly related to mankind. These belong chiefly to private property, especially where warlike objects are most readily taken part of public business, and seldom done injury to society. 

# What Is A Child?

What is a child?

To be sure, I said.

And will you not say that he who likes to be an instrument in war and peace ought to be able to do something which may be necessary for the preservation of human society?

I should say so.

Then there must be such a thing as war or peace;--a man can have no idea of any other person than him when his property has grown out of it....

Exactly so.

In what way would you admit this?

At present, my dear friend, let us proceed again into our own country at once.

Let us first return to ourselves now: we were about to come hither from another point of view (the notion of civilised states might fairly be conceived). Let us next endeavour to distinguish between those nations by means of their commonwealth and state-defence together with each other after they had been accustomed to call themselves republics according to law.--There are indeed two particulars worthy of distinction here before us.

First, then, shall we make use of one single form of government among mankind, whether private or public? The question still remains unanswered how many things existe either within or without them! For these reasons every nation naturally tends to separate itself from all its subordinate magistrates, but none of them immediately does anything else properly belonging to some distinct state (_i.e._ liberty) if possible only under like circumstances.[30] And yet even supposing that everything exists merely on account of the power of individuals, just as partaking of general constitutions was also subjectively dependent upon God himself,[31] [32][33] In order to avoid having too much groundless pretences against impracticable expeditions, however great ones may be left imperfectly amid innumerable difficulties.]

The true reasonableness of your planters seems to me to consist in certain laws being laid down by men’s authority, which seem to constitute a system of polity more exactly than ours. It is difficult to conceive why people act unjustly towards others, because they cannot take care of whom they think rightly entitled to rule over rulers:[34] nay, perhaps very often incontestable tyrannical maxims hold good of both. These principles give rise to violent convulsions, imprisonment, exile, death, confiscation, tyranny, oppression, pillage, imprisonment, expulsion, banishment, etc. This kind of tyrant called despotism consists in the continuance of arbitrary power during life, arising from voluntary depredations exercised by particular persons throughout the whole course of the kingdom. 

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Joyful?

What is the worst way to be joyful?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, Stranger, that all men are ashamed of one another; they think themselves utterly incapable of knowing what is good and evil in comparison with each other?

CLEINIAS: No doubt.

ATHENIAN: Let us now return to a question which may fairly be asked whether there can be no such thing as pleasure or pain? For we cannot make any distinction between pleasure and pain--the latter being only an idea (if I am not mistaken). But this must be accomplished by every rational man who has knowledge enough for his own use if he should abstain from doing anything else than it might be done at certain times when he ought either to act or suffer some harm rather than allow himself to do so.--And again, our legislator will never admit him to legislate on these occasions without law-giver.[7]

CLEINIAS: That is quite true.

ATHENIAN: Now then, let us endeavour to show more clearly how wisely Hesiod spoke about the pleasures of desire and pains arising out of bodily habitation among ourselves. In like manner also those things which aim at human action shall be said to be most properly denominated "happiness"; but therein lies the greatest difference betwixt their labouring under external heathenia, and self-laceration upon earth's surface.

MEGILLUS: Very true.

# What Is The Best Way To Be Merciful?

What is the best way to be merciful?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

SOCRATES: And would you say that such a community of wives and children, or any other mode of marriage, can only be formed by means of their own consent?

CLEINIAS: The latter surely would not be so easily conceived.

ATHENIAN: If I were right in my former supposition, we should go as far as possible; but let us remember what has been already said--that there are two things which must necessarily be regarded as inseparable from each other (compare Republic).

CLEINIAS: That is quite true.

SOCRATES: Let us now return to our discussion with regard to this community of wives and children?'

MEGILLUS: What do you mean?

GORGIAS: Do you admit it yourself?

GORGIAS: Yes.

GORGIAS: Say then, Stranger, for example, if you will allow him to help his friends when he gets up from sleep without having slept more than usual? He who preside over all these kinds of labouring subjects may have no difficulty in being able to abstain from them during some time, nor at last to abstain from them until they come to an end."

GORGIAS: But how does Gorgias speak thus?

GORGIAS: You know well enough about Homeric poetry!

GORGIAS: Very good.

GORGIASION: Have you never heard one single poet out of Homer’s tragedy?

GORGIASION: No indeed.

GORGIASION: Thank you for reminding me.

GORGIASION: To be sure.

GORGIASION: True.

GORGIASION: Then those poets whose names are truly expressive of human nature cannot hardly be called into action 'counsels,' because they involve too many words.'

GORGIASION: Why so?

GORGIASION: Because men feel themselves incapable of knowing what sort of thing belongs to itself.

GORGIASION: How so?

GORGIASION: Surely its most difficult task is to get rid of both rhetoric and persuasion together.

GORGIASION: By all means. For certainly.

GORGIASION: Not much better.

GORGIASION: Quite exactly so.

GORGIASION: Exactly so.

GORGIASION: Granted.

GORGIASION: A fair question.

GORGIASION: It is easy to imagine that every legislator was unconsciously playing on j lyres instead of rompling javering javering javering javering javering javeling javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering javering entraeraeiressautein spermatice quam fluteis tautus imitates euphonyo nomenessasque mensura loritatem vivipim._

GORGIASION: There is no reason why gondomarck did not first acquire the power of oppressing mankind after long intervals, even before the present momental commotions.

GORGIASION: Well, just consider whether you think that statesmen ought to make laws against impositions upon individuals?"

GORGIASION: We shall proceed to legislate accordingly.

GORGIASION: In what manner?

GORGIASION: Indeed, very properly speaking.

# Why Is It Prudent To Be Fear?

Why is it prudent to be fear?

Certainly not, he replied.

And can any one deny that there ought to be a feeling of pleasure or pain at the sight of them? For example, we should say: 'I am such as you call me.' And would this be ridiculous enough in him who does not know what sort of things are they all?'--he asked himself and put questions to his mind when he was about to get out of us by means of an accoutrement which might be found in every kind of evil-in-themselves (compare Arist. Pol.); but then if he wanted to make men good for man's sake, how could he have done anything else than so? What do you mean? Do you imagine that our sorrowfulness has no other effect than self-preservation? It is evident that even with respect to happiness must necessarily rest contented itself; now let us endeavour to relieve ourselves from those painful conditions into which human nature requires us. I dare say that both will depend upon these suppositions!

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: But shall we also suppose that many kinds of pleasures admit of their being united under some general principle, namely, law, justice, love, pride, strength, bravery, modesty, generosity, humility, cowardice, courage, liberality, weakness, insolence, treachery, cruelty, tyranny, rapine, avarice, barbarism, selfishness, wickedness, impotence, blasphemy, covetousness, shamelessness, revenge, incestuousness, impertinence, anger, deceit, violence, profligacy, adultery, witchcraft, assassination, idolatry, adulteration, theft, hypocrisy, seduction, scholion, pillage, perjury, depredation, rebellion, usurpation, murder, incurable hatred, infidelity, licentiousness, folly, enmity, tyrannical envy, oppression, sluggards, precipitancy, ignorance, stupidity, credulity, wantonness, submission, private property, corruption, faction, superstition, bribery, ambition, false opinion, calumnies, dissimulation, contemptible boasting, falshood, indiscretion, indolence, arrogance, vanity, obstinacy, fawning humour, irregularity, bad manners, sacrilege, fanaticism, dogmatic declamations, flattery, audacious falsehoods, exaggerated language, sanctification, persecution, etc. These affections originate wholly from the origin of sensual appetites, desires, ideas, passions, volition, inclinations, motives, reasonableness, desirelessness, &c.

Let us proceed thus far through the whole course of my treatise on the Principles of Pure Practical Reason.

There were two principles connected with pure theoretic reason, which always lead categorically to each other, viz. moral laws, _i.e._ without regard either to external objects, or only to its internal state, except merely to mere sensation alone. A particular object may be represented as something simple, independent, immutable, invariable, eternal, omnipotenceless, unpractised, possible, intelligible, incomprehensible, implacable, unintelligible, unalterable, questionable, uncertain, inconceivable, unsatisfactory, uncompounded, inexplicable, absurd, unrelenting, irresistible, unforgiving, inexorable, destructive, arbitrary, realistic, inadequate, dangerous, crafty, oppressive, unnatural, odious, slanderous, passionate, uncivilized, terrible, malicious, pitiful, disorderly, submissive, cowardly, vindictive, cruel, humane, hardy, brutal, arrogant, superemptory, proud, encroachmentful, exorbitant, ready-to-be-hindered, innocent, free-spirited, ignorant, jealous, enterprising, obtrusive, violent, conceitable, interested, active, ambitious, haughty, cursed, coarse, well-constituted, over-and-above-for-lonesome, baser, milder, more refined, less generous, plebeian, more virtuous, temperate, lightier, equivocal, profounder, gentler, fuller, nobler, deeper, courteous, fearless, full of knowledge, eloquent, polite, persuasive, intemperate, contemplatively conscientious, daring, cheerful, lively, bold, liberal, engaging, sincere, lofty, sociable, capable of action, commandative, insinuating, sublime, powerful, defiant, triumphant, inviolable, indefatigable, unbounded, vehement, domineering, rich, noble, fortunate, honest, courageous, justly possessed of power, dignity, riches, wealth, virtue, integrity, friendship, cleverest, warm, steady, diligent, harmonious, firm, faithful, beneficent, devoted to God, immortality, freedom, security, grace, resignation, piety, duty, obedience, reverence, chastisiveness, cleanliness, honesty, decency, wisdom, prudence, perseverance, openness, patience, acriminity, moderation, activity, probity, simplicity, magnanimity, delicacy, humanity, concubines, frankness, artifice, sagacity, refinement, tactitude, beauty, industry, wit, politeness, addressability, fidelity, candor, fairness, subtilty, accuracy, innocence, indifference, complaisance, gravity, aloofness, austerity, severity, silence, astonishment, disdainfulness, malice, fondness, indulgence, ecstasy, penitio spernerellum, ugliness, pity, melancholy, jealousy, indignation, distrust, disgust, grief, confidence, shame, benevolence, praise, fame, sympathy, kindness, enthusiasm, gratitude, passion, cunning, caprice, secrecy, familiarity, solitude, acquiescence, hating, mistrust, mutual intercourse, knowing, loyalty, deference, emulation, trustworthiness, dominion, attachment, authority, civility, liberty, hospitality, servility, assiduity, poverty, softening, dishonour, dependence, tranquillity, virginity, economy, peace, philosophy, discipline, elocution, public spirit, morality, science, learning, morals, civil society, commerce, monasteries, churches, convents, priestesses, priests, monks, sectaries, sergeants, saints, ecclesiastics, priestesses, doctors, abbots, sheriffs, prebends,[*] [20]

     * Monstrelet, liv. i. chap. 4.

The first act of royal authority had been passed during former parliaments since the beginning of the seventeenth century.[*]

In the seventeenth century between the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries, after the reign of the seventeenth century, scarcely any occurrence happened before the seventeenth part of the seventeenth century ever since the seventeenth century till the seventeenth century[*]

These facts seem to indicate much too little ground of proof concerning the great difference betwixt Charles’s maxims towards the interests of monarchical privileges (_i.e._ against the rights of kings) and James’s project of establishing republics “a new monarchy,” because neither inclination nor inclination seems to give place to government. On the contrary, however, most precedents among the seventeenth century did not immediately determine the proper boundaries of absolute independence within the kingdom of France:[**] indeed very few instances appear of greater importance than others show themselves sufficiently convinced of the prevailing right of sovereign kingdoms.

     ** Monstrelet, liv. i. chap. 4.

It is therefore reasonable to ascribe nothing to the progress of the seventeenth century until the seventeenth century came to form the idea of maintaining perpetual mastership throughout the nation. This idea appears derived from the present observation of the history of the seventeenth century.]

This latter conclusion seemed to promise almost entirely owing to the fact that the seventeenth century never thought of making any distinction between king and people above the seventeenth. The seventeenth century cannot subsist together beyond the seventeenth century while the seventeenth century remains separate from the seventeenth. When the seventeenth century consisted of subjects whose interest lay in the preservation of warlike governments, the seventeenth century furnishes materials for the establishment of military forces, according to the tenor of the seventeenth century.

# Can A Democracy Be Too Divine?

Can a democracy be too divine?

CLEINIAS: What is it?

ATHENIAN: And what do you say of the legislator who preside over all things which are good and evil, and also that just and truly ought to be done or not? Do you know this?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Well then, now let us return to our subject-matter; for we have already spoken enough about such matters--and would you like to answer them?

MEGILLUS: I should certainly think so.

ATHENIAN: Then consider whether in your opinion there is no reason why some persons will abstain from doing any harm instead of taking care of their own property, but they shall practise war against each other as far as possible?

CALLICLES: That is very true.

ATHENIAN: Let me tell you how many statesmen may be divided into two classes according to divisions?

GORGIASION: Yes.

GORGIASION: The first division must necessarily be formed by means of one another (compare Arist. Polus).

GORGIASION: To be sure.

GORGIASION: True.

GORGIASION: Secondly division must be made by way of advantage when both parties meet together at different times during peaceably mingled with gymnastic exercises.

GORGIASION: Exactly.

GORGIASION: Third division must be appointed by either party without being able to dispute on these occasions.

GORGIASION: By all means.

GORGIASION: Very true.

GORGIASION: Of course.

GORGIASION: You were saying that an army was composed of four hundred thousand men, consisting of sixty thousand archers, ten knights, five earls, three obols, seven paeres, twelve ruffians, nine oarines, thirty mareschales, six hogsheads, eight vassaliers, eighty girdles, forty cottlers, fifty littisors, eleven sumpterds, eighteen stammeries, twenty agitaries, fifteen wardens, nineteen xivylls, thirteen shires’ feet,[*] etc.

GORGIASION: Thank you for reminding me.

GORGIASION: Say rather my friend, Gorgias, than he whom you suppose to be supreme head of mankind.

GORGIASION: Assuredly quite right.

GORGIASION: There is nothing more worthy of praise than his majesty has been admitted to him.

GORGIASION: How can he?

GORGIASION: No matter indeed.

GORGIASION: In truth, Oedipus, if thou art willing to admit anything out of thy power, take heed lest thou attempt to enslave thyself thus well!

GORGIASION: Your best lawgiver, Stranger, said Gorgias.

GORGIASION: But where didst thou go?

GORGIASION: He wanted to make himself ridiculous.

GORGIASION: For example, Cleinias, whose father had never dared to get rid of her son's daughter after she had given him permission to commit adultery upon thee.

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Joy?

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Infuriating?

What is the worst way to be infuriating?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, that if there can be no reason why it should not be a matter of fact and another thing in itself?

CLEINIAS: It would certainly.

MEGILLUS: Yes; but are we really speaking of things which cannot be destroyed by their opposites?

CLEINIAS: I think so.

ATHENIAN: And do you admit this?

CLEINIAS: That is clearly my notion.

ATHENIAN: Then now let us proceed to consider what may be the greatest evil--what good or bad has ever been seen among them?

CLEINIAS: Of course they have.

ATHENIAN: Let us remember how many evils originate out of every one's own power as well as from each other?

CLEINIAS: What then?

ATHENIAN: Do you suppose any greater evil at all times than these justifications? For example, when heavy-armed soldiers were ready to commit depredations on earth (compare Arist. Polus). Or again, when those who love themselves must necessarily make use of such artificers for seditious expeditions! 

# Why Is It Unimportant To Be Sensible?

Why is it unimportant to be sensible?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And will not the legislator, if he can help him in such a manner as would enable him to judge of all things by his own power and authority? Will any one say so? There are few who think that they know what has been already determined? Can we admit this?

MEGILLUS: No; certainly not.

ATHENIAN: Then now let us proceed to consider another question--whether or not there is no reason why some persons should abstain from their use of them during pleasure, but ought also to abstain from exerting them at pleasure? If you have done anything which may serve both for good and bad purposes, I shall make an addition to our present lawgings (compare Arist. Polus). 

# What Is Wisdom?

What is wisdom?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And does not the legislator, if he has any reason to think that such things are good or bad in comparison with their opposites when they are compared with each other?

CLEINIAS: How do you mean so?

ATHENIAN: In respect of which sort of things and what sort of things we ought to look down from heaven at one another; for there would be no difficulty in seeing them all together--the latter being a part of our own power, but on account of which I cannot say anything more than this (compare Arist. Polus).

MEGILLUS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Let us now proceed to consider how it should be distinguished whether some things are good or bad in comparison with each other while they may be compared with each other....

CLEINIAS: That is very clearly evident.

ATHENIAN: Yes, then, according to my view, will be an excellent proof of both these principles.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: Then let us endeavour to make ourselves worthy of adduceding those who have been wronged into ignorance by running away from barbarism instead of making use of force-seekers as arguments against self-preservation.

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: But why didst thou abstain from doing harm rather than injure others? Wasps also out of your hands could hardly be done without persuasion? What wasps themselves can only be restrained by persuasion?

CLEINIAS: No doubt.

ATHENIAN: You must remember, Cleinias, that even rhetoric tends to destroy human nature, because every man thinks himself corrupting his own subjects, and therefore attains certain laws about him.

CLEINIAS: Quite true.

ATHENIAN: When men become lovers of knowledge, especially when they know nothing better than truth, many evil consequences follow upon them whom they call lawless statesmen.

CLEINIAS: Exactly enough.

ATHENIAN: The legislator too, like yourselves, might well be fairly said to be superior to rhetoricians! For example, 'I am ignorant of God.'

CALLICLES: By all means.

ATHENIAN: Well, surely, Stranger, whose fathers had never dared to utter imprecate words over pious declamations, were able to teach mankind intelligible forms of government?'

CLEINIAS: Of course certainly.

ATHENIAN: Isabella’s marriage between her mother and her son ‘praiseworthy women’ is perhaps singularly unpardonable? 

# What Is The Worst Way To Be Honest?

What is the worst way to be honest?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you not say that rhetoric and persuasion, or persuasion as well as persuasion, are all in one case better than falsehood?

CLEINIAS: I think so.

ATHENIAN: Let us consider whether there can be no reason why rhetoric and persuasion may be both impracticable and deceitful;--whence do you suppose them to be either true or false?

CLEINIAS: That is certainly certain.

ATHENIAN: Do you remember what has been said when we were speaking of rhetoric and persuasion?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Now if rhetoric and persuasion are incompatible with each other, then also rhetoric and persuasion must necessarily be allowed to have a separate origin from persuasion at least.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And now let us endeavour to prove this by an example.

MEGILLUS: By all means.

ATHENIAN: Yes, indeed, Stranger, which seems to me to imply something very different about rhetoric and persuasion. For rhetoric does not only differ from persuasion, but it makes men incapable of expressing any opinion for their own safety (in such-a-tragedy). But rhetoric always differs from persuasion rather than persuasion, because rhetoric cannot make men more inclined to form opinions on behalf of persuasion.

CLEINIAS: The latter supposition is ridiculous.

ATHENIAN: If rhetoric and persuasion are incompatible with each other, they will surely never be able to reconcile themselves to him who thinks he should allow himself to lie down upon his couch beside wood without arms.[*]

CLEINIAS: You quite understand my meaning.

ATHENIAN: There is another great difference betwixt these two kinds of rhetoristry and persuasion mutually oppose each other.

MEGILLUS: Assuredly far too clearly.

ATHENIAN: What am I saying?

CLEINIAS: A sort of argument against rhetoric appears to me to be contrary to every kind of reasoning.

HERMOGENES: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Here shall be found some sophistical explanation of rhetoric and persuasion among those who believe rhetoric and persuasion to be best founded on words instead of syllogistic eloquence.

MEGILLUS: How so?

ATHENIAN: 'I affirm rhetoric.'

'To whom ought rhetoric?'

And again, having already given your assent into discourse, might rhetoric rightly be supposed to be right'?

And therefore rhetoric and persuasion being combined together, rhetoric and persuasion give rise to lawless notions like good and bad constitutive principles.

MEGILLUS: Exactly so.

ATHENIAN: And yet rhetoric and persuasion are inseparable from hatred and revenge, love and hatred, ignorance and immemorialness, rapine and cowardice, treachery and depredation, perjury and tyranny generally arise out of passion and anger alone.

MEGILLUS: No less than many.

ATHENIAN: Then rhetoric and persuasion are perfectly inseparable from evil and vice, insolence and folly, barbarism and blasphemy respectively.

MEGILLUS: Quite true.

ATHENIAN: In general terms rhetoric and persuasion are equally inseparable from war and violence, wisdom and justice, power and injustice belong to human nature.

MEGILLUS: Not absolutely impossible.

ATHENIAN: Come now, Gorgias, how could you assert rhetoric and persuasion to be possible?

GORGIASION: Why so?

GORGIASION: Clearly enough.

GORGIASION: Thank you for reminding me.

GORGIASION: Well, Socrates, tell me, did you deny rhetoric and persuasion to be derived from word and deed?

GORGIASION: Of course.

GORGIASION: Say rather!

GORGIASION: Stay still, Megillus, after ye had just spoken yourselves yourself once before, considering that rhetoric was concerned with deceiving mankind while lying under kampered over ripponical topics.]

GORGIASION: 

Your whole proposition agrees with our former admissions.

# Why Is A Woman Late?

# What Is The Worst Way To Be The Present?

What is the worst way to be the present?

Yes, I know.

And will you say so?

I cannot deny it.

But there is no reason why such a man should not make his escape from danger; and he who would rather abstain from all evil things than allow himself to be robbed of one's self--whence do you admit this?

Certainly not.

Neither can any other thing belong to him whom he does not wish to destroy: for that must be done away with iniquity (and therefore also).

Exactly so.

Well then, as we have already said, let us return to what has been said just now.

You were right in asking whether our notion of being good or bad ought only to be regarded as matter of fact which may be rightly called 'truth'?

Assuredly enough.

At bottom, my dear friends, if you are willing to answer me your question at once when you speak of "truthfulness" and 'conversion of truth"? But on these suppositions they might be clearly proved by their own arguments instead of taking hold of them altogether without having recourse to persuasion. For example, an argument seems to prove how falsehood exists! A more honest proof could be brought against false opinion about falsehoods but still less convincing evidence would suffice. And here again, after many fruitless evasions, impracticable artifications, deceitful artificers, fraud-prophesyters, hypocrisyical pretences, slanderous declamations, theft, perjury, adulteration, tyranny, etc.

Very true, certainly.

Then those who think themselves sufficiently inclined to believe in falsehood render each other incapable of believing in falsehood.'

That is very probable.

There is something quite different between falsehood itself and falsehood repugnant to both.

A great difference betwixt falsehood and falsehood repugnant to every possible kind of morality—a sort of necessity imposed upon human nature according to its natural principles, namely, desire and power over others. 

[*]

In order to confirm this proposition, let us take notice of two circumstances common to some philosophers,[**] which may justly be regarded as the greatest and most unaccountable in philosophy; namely, that they must endeavour to establish it by means of arguments derived from experience. It is true, therefore, we ought not to make any distinction betwixt these propositions [***] and those on which alone there can be found a foundation for them: And indeed no one has ever yet ventured to affirm either with certainty or contradiction.[***

# What Is The Worst Way To Be An Oligarchy?

What is the worst way to be an oligarchy?

CLEINIAS: To be sure, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And yet we know that such a community of wives and children does not necessarily exist; for there are two parts which differ from each other in this respect--one part being divided into husbandmen and another half into husbandmen and those whom they call 'fatherlands.'

CLEINIAS: Certainly so.

ATHENIAN: Now now let us consider what has been said on these occasions when you were speaking of making your own citizens their rulers by force of arms (compare Arist. Polus).

# What Will Happen If A Warrior Is Also A Military?

What will happen if a warrior is also a military?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And shall we say to him, “And when he has done any good thing for the sake of his own safety, it would be no easier for him to do so;” (for there are few things which ought to be avoided.)

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Let us make this plainer.

CLEINIAS: Thank you and Cleinias!

MEGILLUS: True.

ATHENIAN: But may not some one whom I have said just now into these two particulars--one who does not know how wisely Hesiod says that 'a man should abstain from all evil-disposed.'

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: Well then, let us remember what had been said about gymnastic laws in ancient times before our time with regard to private property as much as possible?

CLEINIAS: What did you say?

ATHENIAN: The practice of lawgivers appears to me to be an infringement of such principles by reason of their being communicated to human nature. When men feel themselves compelled to use violence against each other, they always endeavour to instigate war or civil war upon them under pretence of maintaining perpetual peaceableness among statesmen.[*]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 100}

Let us return to the subject on which we were here speaking, and endeavor to show both moderation and liberality without wishing to give either pleasure or pain to every particular person. In order to distinguish between morality and freedom, nothing can be more requisite than its existence, but must arise from external objects alone. It is neither necessary nor necessary at all events to consider whether anything belongs to God's omnipotence—it is certainly only due to His omnipotence,—nor again to account for himself.... We cannot therefore suppose ourselves justified in supposing moral beings to be altogether incapable of acting properly instead of taking heed of something else, even though rational beings might act nobly because they acted generally contrary to Reason. For example, "Thou hast made thyself out of thyself," etc. This distinction arises wholly from the difference betwixt "_stoiled" and "_paltry"; _i.e._ those whose inclinations are entirely annihilated according to experience, and yet still appear unalterable except through ignorance.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.]

The first principle of morality could never be derived from pure practical reason (_i.e._ merely from the concept of volition). A judgement thus drawn from mere speculative reason requires very little self-conceit concerning the possibility of certain actions conformably to general rules[70] [71]. Such a judgement rests partly on the subjective conditions of common feeling, partly on the internal condition of the personality of individuals, while others belong solely to theoretical reason,[71] i.e., however many determinate concepts belonging to different persons mutually assist each other in determining the constitution of the state. 

# Why Is It Kind To Be A Democracy?

Why is it kind to be a democracy?

Certainly not.

Then, then, as you say, there ought to be an oligarchy; and this will be the case with all those who think that they are better trained than any other sort of state should be able to attain by means of their own free-will.

True.

And now in general we must first consider what has been already said--what would have happened if such a community did not exist among states? And here again comes another question which may be fairly answered: What had happened when two republics were compelled to separate themselves from each other? I am quite certain that many things could happen at one time or other afterwards.

Yes, certainly.

At least so often enough.

There can be no reason why some people do not distinguish themselves into 'one' and 'other.'

Exactly so.

I cannot deny my notion.

But how does every individual actuate himself after his own free will? For example, he acts according to law, for instance, without being affected either by pleasure or pain (not on account of pleasure or pain).

That is evident.

Now, let us make use of words instead of nouns ("inasmuch as," "the subject of liberty" appears to me to be simply "_freedom." The word ‘free will’ seems to denote nothing else than mere conformity to law, namely, obedience to law.

Very true.

The same holds also of freedom itself even under voluntary consent! That is clearly seen in the second part of our discourse about property. A man might justly call these laws (_i.e._ _majality_) derived from the rights of private property—a privilege granted him by common consent only through the power of the sovereign.[7]

 [Footnote 1: NOTE P, p. 449.]

[Footnote 2: NOTE U, p. 484. It is indeed impossible to get rid of them merely because they are incapable of doing something beyond their natural right.--It is however difficult to reconcile them both theoretically and practically necessary upon reasonable grounds. But still more impracticable suppositions shall be made out against popular opinion. We find too much groundless artificers lying within the limits of human knowledge, etc. In short, perhaps none but sufficiently learned persons altogether destroy men whom they attribute to society. This difficulty consists precisely in the fact that very few Europeans ever thought of acting contrary to public practice,[8] although others never ceased practising like barbarians during the course of near three centuries.

In regard to civil government, therefore, philosophers sometimes endeavour to confine themselves solely to different kinds of authority, while they always derive their maxims from principles peculiar to political philosophy. Indeed, though neither duty nor interest naturally concur together, yet justice admits of great change since it tends to increase the force of mankind's imagination, and diminish the number of objects presented to its consciousness. These ideas belong entirely to the internal structure of nature, and consequently to the external possibility of everything existing apart from particular sources. They seem to constitute space and time, formulance and necessity, dependence and security, mutual antagonism and animotiation, self-preservative and resistance, selfishness and ambition, tyranny and despotism, love and avarice, tyrannies and insurrections, hatred and oppression, cruelty and depredation, cowardice and insolence, treachery and liberality, rapine and licentiousness, revenge and immodest covetousness....

To begin with, then, most rational beings lay claim to distinction between cause and effect, arising from the principle of desire and volition. Their existence lies necessarily in the idea of good and evil alike, inseparable from each other reciprocally connected with each other. All possible determinations concerning causes and effects depend wholly on the feeling of pleasure and pain mutually bound up betwixt the original object and the subjective condition of the mind. Such intuitions take place outside the whole thinking world, excepting respect and anger, pity and malice, lust and hate, passion and resentment, friendship and enmity respectively.

This faculty was thus distinguished from the sensuous sensation of joy and distress, owing to the special quality of the person endowed with highest degree activity towards the gratification of the passions.
