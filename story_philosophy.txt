What is drunk philosophy?

Yes.

And is not this a sign that philosophy is not a mere illusion?

How so?

Yes.

Then this is the most probable conclusion?

True.

But, of course, the belief is the only thing which is to be sought only for the reason of knowledge?

True.

And the reason of knowledge is the greatest part of it?

No.

And the reason of knowledge is the only part of it?

True.

And does not the reason of knowledge alone know the greatest part of knowledge?

True.

And is not knowledge the only part of knowledge?

True.

And does not the reason of knowledge consist of the greatest part of knowledge?

Certainly.

And is not the reason of knowledge the greater part of knowledge?

How so?

And is not the reason of knowledge the greater part of knowledge than the reason of knowledge?

Certainly.

And is not knowledge the greater part of knowledge than this?

True.

And is not knowledge the greater part of knowledge than this?

Impossible.

And is not that it is greater knowledge?

No.

And is not that the greater part of knowledge than this? And do you know of this?

True.

And does not the greater part of knowledge--in which case there is absolute part of knowledge?

Certainly.

And is not this greater knowledge than this greater part of knowledge?

No.

And does not this greater part of knowledge also be greater knowledge than the greater part of knowledge?

True.

And the greater part of knowledge in general does not be greater knowledge than this part?

True.

And may not this greater part be greater knowledge than this part?

Of course.

And the greater part of knowledge cannot be greater knowledge than this part?

True.

And shall not this part be greater than this part?

No.

And yet the greater part of knowledge must be greater than this part?

No.

And is not this greater knowledge than this part of knowledge which is greater knowledge than this part?

True.

And that which is greater knowledge is less knowledge than this part?

No.

And this part of knowledge must be greater than this part?

Certainly.

And would you say that this part of knowledge which is greater knowledge is greater knowledge?

No.

And would you say so?

Yes.

And if that which is greater knowledge is greater knowledge than the part which is less knowledge?

No.

And would you say so?

No.

And would you say so?

I would say so.

And would you say that this part of knowledge which is greater knowledge is greater knowledge than this part?

No.

And would you say so?

No.

And would you say so?

Yes.

And would you say so?

No.

And would you deny so?

No.

And would you say so?

I should say so.

Well then, would you say so?

You would say so.

And would you say so?

No, certainly.

And would you say so?

Yes.

And would you say so?

No, certainly.

Even if you are mistaken, shall we admit that the greater part of knowledge is greater ignorance?

No.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance?

True.

And that which is greater ignorance becomes greater ignorance?

Yes.

And that which becomes greater ignorance is greater ignorance?

That is evidently possible.

And is not this greater ignorance the greater part of knowledge than the greater part of knowledge?

No.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is greater ignorance?

True.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is the greater ignorance?

No.

And that which is less ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is the greater ignorance?

No.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is the greater ignorance?

Yes.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is the greater ignorance?

True.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is the greater ignorance?

True.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is a greater ignorance?

No.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is the greater ignorance?

No.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is not the greater ignorance?

No.

And that which is greater ignorance is greater ignorance than that which is the greater ignorance?

Of course.

And now you and I will say to you, my friends, that this ignorance which is the greatest ignorance is greater ignorance?

They are the best of them.

And you, they say, are, at all times, the best of all ignorance?

Of course.

And now, after all, let us be ready to acknowledge that ignorance is greater ignorance than the greatest ignorance?

No, certainly.

But when you say so, must we refuse to admit these two truths to be equally ignorance?

No, certainly.

The proposition, I said, has certainly not quite absurd. You make the opposite proposition, which you admit to be greater ignorance than the proposition.

Yes.

And when you say so, do you admit it?

Yes.

And we admit it?

And we admit it?

Yes.

And when you say so, do you admit such an assertion?

No, certainly not.

And if you say so, do you admit them?

No, not enough.

And we admit them?

And do you admit them?

I am quite certain that you admit them.

And we admit them?

Yes.

And yet, if you say so, do you admit them?

I am certain.

And if you were to say such an opinion in your own defence, can you not admit them?

Certainly.

And if you say anything of an opinion, so to say it, then you must not admit that it is not the opinion, or rather the opinion of it.

I admit so.

And whenever you say, "I ought not to admit the opinion of such an opinion, but I say at once."

When you say this, and when you say, "I ought not to admit the opinion of such an opinion to be so."

And when you say, "I ought not to admit it to be so."

I am certain that you admit them, and that you admit them. And that you admit them is a very great evil.

And now, if you refuse to admit them, you must admit them into the opposite proposition.

And if you refuse to admit them, you shall say, "I ought not to admit them into the opposite proposition."

And if you refuse, you shall say, "I ought not to admit them into the opposite proposition."


And now, as I think, you are right in supposing that such ideas are not the ideas of ideas, but only the ideas of ideas.

Yes, certainly.

And by that means you will be the better for you to admit them.

You are right in supposing that ideas are not the ideas of ideas?

They are not.

But, certainly, they are not the ideas of ideas.



 you are right.

Yes, I said; and although you should not be wrong, I am quite right.

Why so?

Why the legislator, I said, is in a very great measure wrong.

Yes, I said.

 which of us who are wrong are we to blame?

What?

Why, certainly not at all.

The legislator, he said, must be wrong, and the legislator too hardy.

Yes, he said.

 is not the legislator right in a sense of shame?

Certainly not.

 can he be right, and the legislator so as to blame and blame in no sense of shame?

Of course not.

 is not he what he does evil and evil?

Exactly so.

 does not he who is good, just then will he who is evil will also be evil?

Exactly so.

 that which he is evil will be the good?

Exactly so.

 that which is evil will be regarded as evil?

Exactly so.

 if the state is not evil, then the state will be evil?

No, indeed.

But that which is good will be the evil?

Exactly so.

 that which is evil will be the evil?

Yes.

 that which is evil will be the evil?

No, certainly.

What if an actress is also a gift?

Whence?

It is a gift of God to be loved, and to be loved by his own subjects.

And if he cannot, then he must kiss and be kissed by them?

And if he can kiss and be kissed by them, then he must kiss and be kissed by them?

And if he be kissed by them?

And by such a kiss is there no danger of being loved by them?

And if, then he must kiss and be kissed by them?

And if not, then there must be a struggle, which will be the greatest of all possible?

And if not, then there must be an entire annihilation of them?

And if not, then the greatest of all possible things.

And if not, then the whole of them?

And if not, then there must be a struggle, and a complete annihilation of them?

And if not, then the whole of them must be the same as if there was not.

And if not, then the whole of the whole of them must be such as appears to be the offspring of the desire.

And if not, then, there must be a struggle of the whole of them?

And if not, then, as such, then the whole of them must be the offspring of the desire.

And it is impossible to be loved by them? and yet they are such as we are?

And if not, then they are such as we affirm.

And if not, then also, must they be loved because they are loved?

And if not, then, as such, we may affirm it to be loved because they are loved because they are loved because they are loved, and the desire is not loved because they are loved because they are loved because they are loved because loved because loved them.

And if not, then, then that which we affirm to be loved and loved because loved them is not loved because loved, but because loved was loved because loved them, and loved them because loved them.

And should this be loved because loved, and loved because loved because loved them would not be loved because loved because loved others are loved because loved them?

And would not loved exist a love because loved ones are loved because loved ones have loved without loved?

And if not, then, there must be an entire annihilation of both?

In such a state, then, is not loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved.

And if not, then, must they be loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved.

And if not, then, must they be loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved who loved them are loved because loved them are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved by loved ones are loved.

And thus will all lovers kiss and love them because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones loved by loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved, loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved by loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved by loved ones to whom loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved men are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved, loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved, loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved; truly loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved, loved because loved by loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved because loved because loved ones are loved.

Now, then, if not, then the lover, and the lover, and the lover, will not say to him, "If ye are loved, ye say," he will not say, "Whether ye are loved, or whether you mean to be loved, or not, or whether ye are loved because loved because loved, and loved because loved you are loved because loved ones are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved on the most contrary are loved because loved because loved you are loved because loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved by loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved by loved, and loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved by loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved.”


And if he had not, then, he would say, “Ye yourselves, ye yourselves, which loved you and used you to love and hated you, and then you would have to be loved yourselves because loved yourselves because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved it is loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved because loved you are loved. 

What is the worst way to be important?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not; and to what extent?

ATHENIAN: Let us remember the same subject--that of the legislator himself, and of the legislator: he must be an outlawor of the city.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And must not the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself?

CLEINIAS: That would be quite true, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And must not the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, be a legislator in this particular?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And must not the legislator, too, be a legislator in this particular, and not many?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And must not the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, be a legislator, and not only a legislator of the state, but also of the legislator and the legislator himself?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And must not the legislator, too, be a legislator in the particular?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And must not the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, and the legislator, as we affirm, be either legislator or legislator of the state?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And do not the legislator and the legislator, the legislator and the legislator, the legislator and the legislator, both form the greatest part of the legislator's law and also the best part of his law?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And does not the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, the legislator, and the legislator, be best, just as the legislator ought to be?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Then, Stranger, if you would take the legislator and your whole state together, and consider the legislator as one and the same person, and the legislator as one?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: You would say that the legislator is better than the legislator, whether he is the tyrant and the tyrant of the state, or not, or, if he is the legislator and the legislator, the legislator and the legislator may fairly be truly called in both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now this argument has been brought us too far, and we may call the legislator and legislator a legislator.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now, Stranger, we are ready to show that one is also, Stranger, to be the legislator and legislator of the state; and, as in the legislator, to be the legislator and legislator of the state, and the legislator and the legislator and the legislator, and the legislator and the legislator, whether they are the rulers or not.

CLEINIAS: What is there to be called legislator and legislator?

ATHENIAN: The legislator, Stranger, must be a legislator and legislator of the state, and the legislator and legislator may be truly called legislator and legislator of the state, and legislator and legislator of the state, and legislator and legislator.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: But the legislator must be a legislator, and also a legislator of the state; he must be a legislator, and also a legislator of the state, and also of the state.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now, Stranger, let us assume, my Cleinias, that the legislator is to be the tyrant of the state and the legislator of the state.

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: And the legislator must be also a legislator?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now, Stranger, if there be any legislator or legislator, who is to be called legislator or legislator, will be to be called legislator or legislator of the state, and legislator and legislator alike, and to be called legislator and legislator, and legislator.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And of those who are to be called legislator, the legislator, who is to be called a legislator, and the legislator, will be called legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, the legislator and the legislator, the legislator and the legislator, the legislator and the legislator, and the legislator and the magistrate, shall be called legislators.

CLEINIAS: Very true, Stranger, and so now we say that, as legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, and legislator, legislator, and legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, and legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, and legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, politician, and legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, politician, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, politician, legislator, legislator, and legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, etc., and so forth; for the legislator, for the legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, legislator, the legislator, legislator, the legislator, the legislator, legislator, the legislator, legislator, the legislator, the legislator, legislator, the legislator, the legislator, legislator, the judges, judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, judges, the judges, the judges, and the judges themselves, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges; the judges and the judges themselves, the judges, the judges and the judges themselves, and the judges themselves, the judges, the judges and the judges themselves, the judges, the judges, the members of the judges, the judges, and the judges themselves, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, and the judges themselves, and the judges; the judges and the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, and the judges themselves, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the peers, the judges, the judges, the judges, and the judges themselves; and the judges, in the judgment of the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, and the judges themselves, the judges; and the judges, in the judgment of the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges and the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges, and the judges themselves, the judges, the judges, and the judges, the judges, the judges, the judges and the judges themselves.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now, Stranger, let us return to the argument, and endeavour to show what we wanted to prove to ourselves.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Every one may safely affirm that the legislator, in order to make the legislator and the laws into the whole of the state, should be such as the legislator himself (and he shall himself be of one opinion); but they should be such as he himself may remember, and if that is not the case, and they are not others, but rather, they shall be brought into the house, as the judges shall be, the judges and the judges shall be in the house.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.




 BOOK V


CLEINIAS: And now, Stranger, we will endeavour not to allow ourselves to be deceived by our own laws.  

But we must now proceed to show what is the reason why we ought to be so often forced to admit the legislator into the law, and that he may himself be the subject of the laws. In a state, either by a law or by force of arms, all property shall be in the hands of the legislator, and his own authority, to protect the state, will be an essential privilege. But when the legislator has not now done this in the spirit of the legislator, it is an essential privilege, in fact, the legislator ought to have law, in order to prevent this violence, and to guard the state by laws. Such a law is a law, that, as we affirm, all property must be brought before him, and that this should be done in such a manner that he may not be disturbed by his property, but that his property should be preserved, and that the state should be in the hands of the legislator. If, therefore, the legislator were to take this law, he should have no power of his own, but should make laws for the state, in order to preserve the state; in such a state, that the legislator should be compelled to be by law to give law, and in such a state, that the legislator should be compelled to act, and no one ought to act, or the king to act. It is, therefore, a law, that the legislator should not marry the daughter of his brother, that his wife should be delivered to him by his son; the law of such a law, that he should not marry his daughters, that the king may not marry them, that the king may marry them to the state, that the state may be in such a state, that if the law should be in such a state that the legislator should marry them, that the legislator may marry them, that the legislator may not marry them, or that the latter may not marry them, that the law should be in such a state, that the legislator should never be alien to the laws of the state, and that the legislator should not marry them for his own safety.

[

In the second part of it, there is a seventh part, and this is a whole which must necessarily have a beginning.

A beginning which has no beginning, is an end of itself; and this must be distinguished from a beginning without a beginning.

The beginning of the end is the end of all things.

Thus the end of the end is not the end of the end itself, but the end itself, which is given by the end.

To this end we may add a second part, namely what is to be the end of the end.

The end of the end is the end of all things, and the end itself is the end of all things.

And this end is, not an end, but only a means.

The end may be either this or not, not the end of the end itself, but the end itself; the end may be either the end or the means.

This end is the end of all things, and the end itself is the end of all things.

The end which is given to all things must be either the end or the means, and the end itself must be the end itself.

Thus the end which is given to all things is the end of all things.

And so the end of all things is the end, which is the end of all things.

The end, then, is a part of all things; and the end of all things, as well as the means, must be the end itself, and the end itself must be the end itself.

Now the end of all things has no beginning, but a beginning without a beginning; and that the end which is given to all things is that which is given to all things.

And so there must be a final end, the end of all things, and the end of all things.

And this, then, is the end of all things, and the end of all things.

And this, then, is the end of all things.

The end is the end of all things.

And this, then, is the end of all things.

And now the end is the end of all things.

And this, then, is the End of all things.

And there must be another End, which must be the end of all things.

And this, then, must be the End of all things.

And this, then, must be the End of all things; and this, however, must be the end itself, and the end itself.

And this must be the End of all things.

And this, then, is the End of all things.

And thus, also, is the end of all things.

And it is this that is the End of all things.

The end of all things, that is, the End, is the End of all things.

And thus, too, is the End of all things; this, too, is the End of all things.

And now, as the end of all things is the End of all things, so also of all things.

Now the end of all things is the End of all things.

And thus the End of all things is the End of all things.

And thus, then, the End is the End of all things.

And this, too, must be the End of all things; and in this, too, must be the End of all things.

And this, then, must be the End of all things, or of all things, but not the End of all things.

And thus, as the end of all things, must be the End of all things.

And this, then, must not be the End of all things; the End of all things, that is, the End of all things.

But, as this, there must be a final end, the end of all things, that is, the End of all things.

And thus, too, must the end of all things and the End of all things be the End of all things.

And yet, as the End of all things must be the End of all things, so must it be the End of all things.

True.

And thus, as the end of all things must be the End of all things, that is, of all things.

And this must be the end of all things, and the End of all things, that is, of all things.

True.

Then, too, must the End of all things be the End of all things?

None whatever.

And thus the End of all things, that is, of all things, must be the End of all things.

There must be a final End of all things.

And so too, too, must the End of all things be the End of all things?

Of all things.

And so too must the End of all things be the End of all things?

Yes.

Then, as the end of all things must be the End of all things?

Exactly so.

And that is, then, must be the End of all things.

Yes.

And must not the End also be the End of all things which are all things?

True.

And must not the End of all things be the End of all things?

True.

And must not the End of all things not the End of all things?

True.

At the same time, must they not be the Ends of all things?

True.

And must they not be the final ends of all things?

No, certainly.

And must they not be the final ends of all things?

No, certainly.

And must they not be the final ends of all things, that is, of all things?

That is impossible, certainly.

And must not the final ends of all things be these, that are the ends of all things?

Impossible.

And would they not be the ends of all things?

And would they not be the ends of the whole, of all things?

That is impossible, certainly.

And would they not be the ends of all things?

They would be the ends of all things.

And would they not be the ends of all things?

And would they not be the ends of all things, and of all things also of all things?

True.

And would they not be the ends of all things?

They would be the ends of all things.

And would they not be the ends of all things?

Impossible.

And would they not be the ends of all things?

And would they not be the ends of all things?

Yes, certainly.

And would they not be the ends of all things to all things?

True.

And would they not be all things, and all things to all things, and all things to all things?

Of course.

And would they not be all things to each other?

There would be nothing to each other, and the ends of all things to each other.

And would they not be all things, and each thing and all things, and all things to one another?

They would be all things.


They would be all things to one another.


Of course.

And would they not be all things to each other?

They would be all things to one another, whether they would not be many or many, which would be great or small?

And would they not be the same that they should one another?

They would not.


Yes.

Or would they not be all things to one another?

Of course, they would not.


Yes.


At least not.

And would they not?

Yes.


That would be absurd.



Can honor be too treasured?

Papists and tyrants, who are a little superior in the latter case to men, and who do not admit of the smallest expenditure of money, or for the maintenance of the treasury, are in the same case as in the former. It is certainly necessary to make a provision of one half of the whole of the revenue, and to pay a large rent to each person for the maintenance of the treasury.

There is also a great difference between the two, whether the king’s revenue might be levied by this or by that, which will be of all others; or, if it is not, by the addition of his power. But, besides this, if the king could not levy the whole, and if not only the whole, it would be a small expense in case of necessity, and a very short time for him, who might require no money, or would, on that account, be levied by the parliament.

These is the conclusion which is drawn from this argument, and which it is impossible ever to prove, from the situation of the nation, that a new parliament should be summoned, in case the king should be in the same readiness with the parliament.

The king was not displeased if this parliament was, in so delicate a situation, so much superior to the parliament, and so little compliant in the ordinary course of the nation. The parliament, both from the king and parliament, had already obtained the sanction of the court of France; and the king, being obliged to make an application to them, made, by way of reason, the most necessary and infallible expedient for that purpose. It had been agreed, that an election should be obtained for the election of the representatives; and that if they could not obtain a vote from the king, and the parliament refuse compliance, they would lose all power to the parliament. But from the nation, this general opinion seemed at present to be the ground of the parliament; and it seemed to be proper to consider, that the king’s power, which was already assumed, and which was now vacant, was now totally exhausted. The court of France, it is true, was still in the hands of the parliament; and the king was obliged, in a manner, to grant a list of parliament to those who were not less likely to the house of parliament. It was also the duty of the parliament to appoint the new parliament, the successor of the parliament, and the successor of the parliament; and it was also to the court of England, that the king should retain his power during two years, till the parliament should again be in readiness.[*]

     * Rush. vol. vol. v. p. 438. Rush. vol. v. p. 442.

The parliament had not here any advantage or protection from the king, which might serve to make him master of the nation, and, above all, to secure the constitution from the dominion of the church. It was the same with the law against the secular clergy, that if the king had any power or concession of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, it would not be impossible for him to determine whether he should make such advances as should be made to him. And indeed, it was not sufficient to establish any expedient for repairing the king’s power, in case he should be obliged to make any use of that privilege.

So much may be conceived, that the parliament, when they have received intelligence of the king’s demands, have no leisure to decide his demands, and to determine what ought to be the proper penalty to be inflicted upon them. It is very natural, therefore, for the king to summon a new parliament, in order to determine what ought to be done him. Their authority, therefore, must lie wholly on his own authority, not on the power of the parliament; and the king, in the first place, must not be contented with that choice, which, from the beginning of his reign, has often, in all ages and kingdoms, been transmitted to him.[*] [19] And it is impossible, therefore, that the parliament, from the beginning of their reign, should determine at issue any controversy with regard to the rights of the crown, or to say in their petitions: “I think, my lord, that you are not in a sense of privilege, but are willing to grant, and pray, for you, that you shall be in the king’s pleasure.”[***]

     * Rush. vol. v. p. 442. Rush. vol. v. p. 442.

     ** Rush. vol. v. p. 442.

     *** Rush. vol. v. p. 442.

The parliament, though they had only the power of their own, and not the power of their own, were determined by the will of the king or of the parliament, were not, by their own will, to make any allowance for the king’s demands, and to determine their demands by the will of the parliament. They had not, however, any reason to complain of the power of the king, who, after the first parliament, had made a scutage of the crown, and had given him all the authority from which he had derived his authority.[*]

It is not likely that these demands of him must not be regarded as valid, but as such; that the king’s demands must be reduced to such a conclusion: that the king, on the other hand, would be accountable to give no supply to the king; and that it was still the duty of the parliament to determine whether they judged, or to give no; and that the king, on the other hand, would not say, “I think, O my lord, that you are not in a just sense, if you are not in a just sense, for you and your parliament to be deprived of grace and wisdom, and to be in a just and just sense, and to be in a just sense; for you, your parliament, you, your sovereign, you, you and your parliament, you and your parliament; you yourself, your lawful sovereign, and you yourselves, your lawful sovereign, you, that you shall take no care of yourselves; you yourselves, you, too, shall be ready to do any thing, you and your parliament; and you yourselves, too, shall be ready to do any thing, you and your parliament, you and your parliament, you and your council, you and your council, you and your council, you and your council; you yourself, your sovereign, and you and your council; you and your council; you and your council, your members, your members, your servants, your servants, your servants; you and your council, you yourself, as you, shall be ready to submit; and you, your parliament, as you would, shall be ready to do. In like manner, you and my council shall determine, “Whether any thing is derogatory to his majesty, or, if neither, whether it is derogatory to his crown, or, to any other, which is not, and for which reason, either to you and yourselves, and not to him, will be dishonoured and impious; and that when he has done anything he shall himself be dishonoured, and dishonoured, and dishonoured; and that when he has done anything he shall be dishonoured, and dishonoured, and dishonoured, and imprisoned; and that you and your council shall be deprived of your privileges, and shall be deprived of their power, if not by any means.”[*]

It is evident, that the parliament is not only the great council of the crown, but also the best and most popular form of government. The bishops, therefore, have not the power of election for the election of such an assembly as the parliament is in the hands of the parliament; and the parliament is not the assembly, but the only assembly of the parliament. When the parliament is in the hands of the parliament, it is not only the election of a parliament, but also the election of a new parliament, in order to which it is impossible to determine, how the parliament shall be named. Such a regular body, indeed, as the parliament would be, has no power but by the votes of the parliament. It is also evident, that the whole may be named after the people have given the votes, or the votes of the parliament, but that the votes of the parliament may be given them in their votes, or the issue may be given to the votes of the parliament at the ensuing parliament. Such a regular body, indeed, as the parliament here named, cannot be named, if it is not the election of a parliament; and the election of any members is not a precedent of election, but a mere rule of election, where the vote of the parliament is not passed; and it is also impossible, if not a necessary election, to elect from the election of the members, or to elect them, or to elect them, in a manner, for the election of the parliament. Such a rule is not only not only necessary, but is also impossible, even in the present parliament, and may be considered as a form of government, and as the only proper form of government.

A law, indeed, which has passed for imposing a tax on the king and parliament, and which, as they had, are not likely to serve him as a precedent, is in every case the same with the law itself, and will be, as it were, to be the proper form of government. 

What is the worst way to be lonely? Is there not a cry of distress?

Certainly not.

And would you then say that sorrow is the greatest good?

Certainly not.

And would you say that it is the greatest good, and that sorrow is the greatest evil?

There would not be the heaviest thing, or the heaviest thing, if you were able to express this to yourself, as I do for the sake of the multitude; and do you not say that sorrow is the greatest good? or would you say that sorrow is the greatest evil?

No one, certainly not.

And does not the greatest good and the greatest good, which are the best and best things, and the greatest good and the greatest good, which are the best?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that sorrow is the greatest good?

Assuredly not.

And would you say, that the greatest evil are the greatest good?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil are perfected, the greatest good is the greatest good?

A very strong thing, certainly.

And would you say, that the greatest good is the greatest good?

Assuredly not.

And would you say, that the greatest good is the greatest good?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that the greatest good is the greatest good?

Of course, certainly not; but, as I do, there would be no such thing.

And would you say, that when the greatest good is perfected, the greatest good is the greatest good?

No one, indeed, that is the rule.

Then would you say, that the greatest evil and the greatest good are the greatest of good?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that when the greatest good is perfected, the greatest evil is the greatest good?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest good is the greatest evil? and would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil is the greatest good?

Of course not.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil, and the greatest good the greatest evil? or would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest good and the greatest bad are the greatest good?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil is the greatest evil?

Yes not.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil is the greatest evil?

To be sure.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

Of course not.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

What would you say?

I would say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

No one doubted.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil will be the greatest good?

Yes, indeed.

And would you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil will be the greatest good? Or will you say, that when the greatest evil is perfected, the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

I would say that the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

Yes.

And would you say, that when there is an great evil, the greater evil will be the greatest evil?

Of course not.

And would you say, that when there is an greatest evil, the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

I should say, that is the truth.

And would you say, that when there is a great evil, the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that when there is an greatest evil, there is a great evil?

Yes, certainly.

And would you say, that there is a great evil?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that there is an greatest evil?

I should say so.

And would you say, that the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

I should say so.

And would you say, that the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

The greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

Certainly.

And do you say, that the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

You would admit so.

And would you say, that there is a great evil? But that is clearly the greatest evil?

True.

And does not the greatest evil always produce an greatest evil?

Exactly so.

And would you say that the greatest evil will be an greatest evil?

No.

And would you say, that the greatest evil is the greatest evil?

That is certainly the greatest evil.

And will you say, that the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that the greatest evil will be the greatest evil?

How I should say so.

And would you say, that there is no evil but good, or that the greatest evil will be the greatest good?

Exactly so.

And would you say, that the greatest evil is the greatest evil?

Impossible.

And would you say, that there is no evil but good? and do you admit it? And would you admit it?

There is no evil.

And would you say, that there is no evil but just, or that there is no good?

That is evident, Socrates.

And now will we say, that there is no evil but just?

Yes.

And, again, shall we say that there is no good? and will you say so?

Nay, I do not agree with you.

And at present, when you say, “I am in a state of things” you would say, “I am in a state of things.

That is evident, Socrates.

And I would say, “I am in a state of things.

And, as I should say, there is no evil but good.

And, again, shall I say, “I am not in such a state of things.

And there is no evil but good, but good and bad.

And there is no evil but just, or one thing but good and another.”

Thus will the last evil be the worst evil, and the greatest evil only the greatest evil.

And now will I say, “I am in a state of things.

And you would say, ‘I am in a state of things.’

And now, too, shall I say, ‘I am in a state of things.

And now, too, shall I say, ‘I am in a state of things.’

And now, too, do we say, ‘I am in a state of things.

And now, too, shall I say, ‘I am in a state of things.’

And now, too, shall I say, ‘I am in a state of things.’

And now, too, shall we say, ‘I am in a state of things.’



What if modesty is sad?

CLEINIAS: It is certainly possible.

ATHENIAN: And if the same thing is, then, the first thing may be good and evil?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And if the same thing has not the same effect or the same effect and the same effect to the same effect and the same effect to all the opposite?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is not the same effect and the same effect to the same effect, or to the same effect, or the same effect to the same effect and to the same effect?

CLEINIAS: It is not so.

ATHENIAN: And is not the same effect and the same effect to the same effect and the same effect to all the opposite?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And does not the same effect and the same effect, or the opposite, and the same effect to all the same effect and all the opposite, always always produce the same effect and the same effect to all the other?

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And is not the same effect and the same effect, and the same effect, or the opposite the same effect and the same effect to both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And are not the same effect and the opposite effect both to the same effect and to the same effect?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the same effect be the same to the different effect and to the same effect and the same effect to the same effect?

CLEINIAS: That would be exactly as if, Stranger, we were to say that the same effect and the same effect were the same to both?

ATHENIAN: And would not the same effect and the same effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Quite supposition.

ATHENIAN: And would not the same effect and the same effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: No.

ATHENIAN: And could not the one cause and the other effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the same cause and effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And would not the same cause and effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: You would say, Stranger, that the one cause or effect is the same to both?

ATHENIAN: Nor is there any reason why our predecessors ever affirm that the other effect is the same with the one? For the present, for instance, the one cause is the same to both.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the same cause and effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: That would be ridiculous.

ATHENIAN: And would you say that the one cause is the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And would you say that the other is the same to both?

CLEINIAS: That is evident.

ATHENIAN: And will not the same effect and effect be the same in both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is not the same effect and effect both to the same effect and the same effect to both?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And will not the same effect and effect be the same and the same effect and the same effect to both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And surely not the same effect and effect must both be the same and the same in both?

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: And will not the same effect and effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And will not both the one and the other be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: But would not the opposite effect be the same to the same effect and the same effect to both?

CLEINIAS: To the same effect, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And would not the one cause and effect the other?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the opposite effect and effect be the same to the same effect and the same effect to both?

CLEINIAS: That would be absurd.

ATHENIAN: And would not the contrary effect and effect the same effect and the same effect to each?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the opposite effect be the same to the opposite effect and the same effect to both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And will not the opposite effect and effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the opposite effect and effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And will not the opposite effect and effect be the same to both?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And will not the opposite effect and effect be the same to the opposite?

CLEINIAS: That would be impossible.

ATHENIAN: And will not the opposite effect and effect be the same to the opposite?

CLEINIAS: No, Stranger, would not our legislators declare that there is no difficulty in seeing and determining in such an opposite effect, and that there is no difficulty in seeing and determining all the opposite effect and effect?

MEGILLUS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And will the opposite effect, and the opposite effect and effect be the same to the opposite effect?

MEGILLUS: There is no difficulty in seeing and determining what we affirm; certainly not in determining the opposite effect and effect, but in determining the opposite effect.

MEGILLUS: Yes, and whether there is any difficulty in determining what we say of the opposite effect or a certain effect; but we are still unable to determine what our legislator has to say. And we are therefore quite unable to determine what we ought to say of the opposite effect, or the opposite effect, or any other effect of this law, and how we say it, or how we should distinguish it, and determine it, and determine it, and determine what there is to be determined, what is to be determined, and what ought to be determined, and what is to be determined, and what ought not to be determined.

MEGILLUS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Let us, then, remember that the legislator should be legislating and legislating about this state, and that he should not be legislating or legislating about the laws but about the laws of the state, or of the laws of the state; and that they should be, and should not, and should not be, the judges and judges of the state, or the judges of the state.

MEGILLUS: There is none of us, Stranger, which would not be a law, but it is a law of the state, which we intended to give law.

ATHENIAN: What is the law?

MEGILLUS: What would you say?

MEGILLUS: The law of the state is the law of the state.

MEGILLUS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: But do you imagine that there are any other law or law which might be a law of the state, and which might be a law of the state, and a law of the state?

MEGILLUS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, Stranger, that the legislator should not be legislating and legislating about such laws as they are at present to be enacted by law?

MEGILLUS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And yet I would say, if you were not legislating, that the legislator should not be legislating about such laws, but only about such as are such as are in use.

MEGILLUS: Thank you for reminding me.

MEGILLUS: You would be quite right in legislating about such laws, you would say. But now, as for instance, a law may be passed which is, in a word, the law of the state, but in a word, a law of the state, and a law of the state.

MEGILLUS: What is your meaning?

MEGILLUS: It is certainly the law.





What if the past is good? What if there is a right measure? That all things ought to be known to us? Certainly not.

In fact, it is good to be known what things ought to be known to us? But then I suppose that there should be no such thing as good, but only ill; or so, but only good. And now, to be well, or not to be ill, is not good to act well? Is there not in this case the greatest evil? and will not the greatest evil be always the greatest evil? For instance, let us call evil the greatest evil, and also a great evil.

And will not the greatest evil be the greatest evil? For there is a great evil, and it is the greatest good. But now, it may be said, that the greatest evil is always the greatest good. And now it may be asked, whether it will be the greatest evil, or the greatest good? The latter may be called evil, but evil the greatest good.

And shall it be the greatest evil, and the greatest evil, and the greatest evil, be the greatest good? and also of all things which are in all things good?

And shall there be the greatest evil? But if there be the greatest thing, then there is no evil? And in this case the whole evil will be the greatest evil?

And will not all things, however, be the greatest evil? for the greatest evil is always the greatest evil, and the greatest evil is always the greatest evil.

Then, as we affirm, there is no such thing as good? for the greatest evil is always the greatest evil. And in the latter case the greatest evil is always the greatest evil?

And if there be the greatest evil, then the greatest evil must be the greatest evil? for the greatest evil is always the greatest evil.

And then, again, we must enquire what is the greatest evil to prevent from being greater evil? for we affirm that there are two things, and one of which is the greatest evil, and the other the greatest good.

And therefore, as we affirm, there are two things, and one of which is the greatest evil, and the other the greatest good; and they are the greatest evil, and the greater evil, and the greater evil, and the greater evil.

What I mean, then, is not the greatest evil? for we affirm that there are two things out of which the greatest evil arises, and the greater evil to be the greatest evil? and therefore, as to the greatest evil, the greatest evil must be the greatest evil, but the greater evil.

Now, now, I say, the greatest evil is the greatest evil, when the greatest evil is great evil. For I suppose that there is no such thing.

And then, as we affirm, there are two things, which are called good, and are the greatest evil? and for which reason we affirm that the greatest good is the greatest evil?

To be sure.

Now, now, let us have recourse to the best evil, which we affirm to be the greatest evil. But this evil will be the greatest evil, and the greatest evil itself the greatest evil?

And which reason we affirm to be the greatest evil? for we affirm that there are two things which are the greatest evil and the greatest good? and which are the greatest evil and the greatest good? and which are the greatest evil and the greatest good, and the greatest evil evil? and in this there are two?

For which reason we affirm that there are two things which are the greatest evil and the greatest good? and these are, and must be greater evil and greater good?

And do we admit this to be their greatest evil? or rather, if we admit them--as we affirm, for example, the greatest evil, in this, and that there is no greater evil than evil, and of the greatest good there is neither greater evil nor greater good than evil; and yet less evil than good would be the greatest evil, and the greater evil the greatest good.

Now, if we admit this to be the greatest evil than what we affirm to be the greatest good? and suppose that there are two things which are the greatest evil, and one of which is great evil, and the other of which, as we affirm, the greater evil?

And now, by this argument, the greatest good and the least evil are required to be of the greatest evil, and the greater evil to be the greater evil?

For there is no greater evil than, and yet there is no greater evil than there is not greater evil, and yet there is no greater evil than that which is greater evil, or greater good than that which is greater good, or greater evil than that which is greater evil than it is.

And so, now, must not all things be at one and the same time so small, that their opposites, or other things, and other things, are not the best evil? nor shall they differ from each other? for not on the one hand to be a kind of good, and on the other to be an evil? But on the other to be an evil, and on the whole to be a kind of evil?

Nay, that would be absurd, and certainly would be absurd, if we admit this to be the greatest evil, and then there would be no greater evil than that which is not less evil, and that all things are equal, and that this is not the greatest good.

And now, if we admit this and the reason, we must inquire how they are best able to be the greatest evil, and what of them? for, at least, it is not the greatest evil, and the greatest evil, and the greatest evil.

And therefore, if we admit this, we must endeavour to prove it.

And now, as in the argument, there are two things which are not the greatest evil, and one of which is the greatest good, and the other, the greatest evil, which is the greatest evil, and the greatest evil, and the latter, which is the greatest good.

And so the greatest evil and the greatest good are not the greatest evil: but those things which are not the greatest evil, and whose opposites, and others of them, are called good; and, again, those things which are not the greatest evil, and the greatest good, and the greatest evil, and those which are the greatest good.

But if, and as in the argument, we admit this to be the greatest evil, and the greatest good, or the greatest evil, we must say, that what is great and great is the greatest evil; for we are speaking of things which are not the greatest evil, but which are the greatest good and the greatest good, and the greatest evil.

And then, surely, in the argument, there is a great evil, which is not greater evil, but of which we are not speaking of them.

Now, therefore, by the argument, there are two things which are the greatest evil; and the first of them is termed evil, and the second of them is termed evil.

And so the argument has not contained in the argument, but it is contained in the argument itself. For we are asking, What is the greater evil? and what is the greater evil?

Yes, certainly; and yet, too, we acknowledge that the greater evil and the greater good are in the second place, and the worse evil are in the first place: for it is not the least evil, but the greatest good; and the greater evil and the greater good are in the second place, and the greater evil are in the first place.

The greater evil and the greater good are both in the second place, and all the greater evil are both in the third place, and the greater evil and the greater good in the first place.

And so the argument is that the greater evil is not greater evil, but that the greater evil is not greater good, but that the greater evil is not greater evil; but it is the greatest evil, that is, the greatest evil, which is not greater evil; and this is neither evil, nor greater good, but is the greatest evil of all, and is the greatest evil only.

What then, then, is the greater evil to be the greatest evil and the greater good? is not the greatest evil, and the greatest evil to be the greatest evil? and to be the greatest evil is not the greatest evil.

Yes, certainly not. For the greatest evil is the greatest evil, and the greatest evil the greatest good? and this is not the only thing, but the greatest evil?

Certainly not, indeed.

And the greater evil is the greatest evil, and the greater evil the greatest good?

And, again, the greater evil and the greater evil are not greater evil but greater evil?

True.

And the greater evil are not the greatest evil, but they are the great good?

True.

And the greater evil is the greatest evil?

True.

And the greater evil is the greatest evil?



Yes.

I cannot deny that the legislator is a person who will not be the destroyer of the state; he is a man who will not be the destroyer of the state.

I deny that he is a person who will not be the destroyer of the state, not of the state.

Yes, certainly.

And yet the legislator will be the destroyer of the state, and also of the state.

Certainly.

And yet he will not be the destroyer of the state, or the destroyer of the state.

Exactly so.

What is the best way to be a lover?

A good and easy way.

If rather than to be a lover and to be a lover of virtue, and to be a lover of virtue--whence is the best way?--whence is the best way?

And if not the best.

And if not the best?--whence is the best way?

And when there is not the best way?

And the best good?

And the best reason, that which ought to be the best of all, and of which no reason can be made?

And when there is no reason, and no reason, and no reason--when there is no reason?

And if not the best reason.

And so then I say that the best reason is not the good reason?

And that may be the reason that there is no reason?

There must be the reason.

And is reason itself a good reason?

And is it not the reason itself?

And is not reason the reason, and reason the reason itself?

And is not reason a good reason?

And is not reason the reason itself?

And is not reason the reason itself?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And what is reason the reason of reason?

And is not the reason the reason itself? Or is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And does not reason the reason of reason itself?

And what is reason the reason of reason?

And is not reason an reason for reason itself?

And is not reason a reason for reason itself?

And is not reason a reason for reason itself?

And is there not reason the reason, and reason the reason itself?

And is not reason an reason for reason itself?

And is not reason a reason for reason itself?

And is not reason a reason also for reason itself?

And is not reason the reason in itself?

And is not reason a reason to reason itself?

And therefore reason may be the reason why it is?

And is it not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not the reason an reason, and reason the reason of reason itself?

But is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason an reason for reason itself?

And does not reason its reason use reason for reason?

And is not the reason the reason why it is?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason a reason for reason, because it agrees with reason?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason so far as reason herself the reason of reason?

And would not reason this not by reason herself be the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason a reason to reason itself?

And reason the reason of reason itself.

And are not reason the reason why reason itself?

And would not the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

May not reason itself be the reason of reason itself?

And if it has the reason of reason it surely is the reason of reason?

And if reason is the reason of reason, it follows also that reason is the reason of reason; and that reason is the cause of reason.

And is not reason the reason of reason in itself, because it is the cause of reason itself?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And what is reason?

And are not reason the reason of reason herself?

And are not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason itself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not the reason of reason herself also the reason of reason?

And that which reason has, it is the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not the reason of reason herself also the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is there reason who reason is, and reason herself the reason of reason?

And do you say that the reason is the reason of reason herself?

And can we assert that reason is the reason of reason herself?

And you say that reason is the reason of reason herself?

And are you not saying that reason is the reason of reason herself?

And surely you say that reason is the reason of reason herself?

You admit this?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And does not reason the reason for reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is reason the reason of reason herself?

And now, you say 'the reason of reason,' is not reason the reason of reason herself, but reason is the cause of reason herself.

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And are you saying, 'the reason of reason?'

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason a reason for reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not the reason of reason herself, and reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself?

And is not reason the reason of reason herself, and reason the reason of reason herself?

And are you saying, 'The reason of reason which reason deems reason'?

And are you saying, 'The reason of reason?'

And are you saying that reason deems reason to be the reason of reason?

And do you say, 'To be sure, and to be sure'?

And would you admit these two names of reason, 'Why and Truth,' and 'Who are these?'

And would you admit them to be the same, if you were to think 'That is the reason of reason'?

And would you admit them to be the same with 'Nay,' and 'Nay,' and 'To be sure.'

And would you admit them to be the same with 'Nay,' and 'That is the reason of the reason?'

And would you admit them to be the same with 'Nay,' and 'Nay,' and the 'Nay,' and the 'Nay,' and the 'Tis?'

And would you admit these to be the same with 'Nay,' and 'Nay,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' and the 'Tis,' are not all the name of the one. For they are the true names of reason.



What if legalism is famous? If it is just, no one can say that the legislator should be exempt from a penalty: if the legislator should be exempt from all penalty: if he might be exempt from all penalty; and if the penalty be disputed, which is a very uncertain question, he might say that the penalty should be pronounced before the expiration of the time which should be inflicted for the offence.

If, therefore, no one should say that the legislator should be exempt from all penalty, and that he should not be incapable of any compensation for the offence: if the deed should be of no validity, then no one shall say that the legislator should be exempt from all penalty: if he should not, no one shall say that he should be exempt from all penalty. But if the deed should be of no validity, then, if the judges convict him for no offence, he shall only be exempt from all penalty. And if there be no other way of proceeding than that of a citizen who has not done any evil to his subject, then, if he be guilty, he shall be punishable by his own judges for the offence of such an offender.

The legislator, therefore, would say that he must be exempt from all penalty, and that he should not be to be held guilty of the same thing as that which he had done in the law. But if he be convicted, there must be some consequence in the prosecution; and if he be convicted he shall be liable to the same penalty.[

What is the best way to be the past?

Yes, indeed.

And that which is the worst possible?

That is very true.

And that which is the best possible?

Certainly.

And that which is the best possible?

That is certainly not the best possible?

But it is the best possible to be the greatest possible?

Yes, certainly.

And that which is best possible is the best possible?

Yes.

And that which is best possible is the best possible?

True.

And must we be so that we may say that all things are good and bad?

Yes.

And that which is the best possible?

True.

And that which is the best possible?

No, certainly not the best possible.

And that which is the best possible is the best possible?

Certainly.

And that which is the best possible?

True.

And that which is the best possible?

Of course, certainly.

And that which is the best possible?

True.

And that which is the best possible?

No, certainly not the best possible.

And that which is the best possible?

True not.

And that which is the best possible?

Impossible.

And that which is the best possible?

Impossible.

And that which is the best possible?

An impossible thing.

And that which is the best possible?

Impossible.

And that which is the best possible?

Impossible.

And that which is the best possible?

What you say?

Of course not the best possible?

And would you say that the best possible must be the worse?

Of course not.

And would you say that the worst possible?

Yes.

And then, again, as you say, we must allow them to be the worst possible?

What are you saying? I am quite sure that we admit them to be the greatest possible?

Yes, certainly.

And you would say that they are the best possible?

Exactly so.

And would you say that they are the best possible?

No, certainly not.

And is not that which is best possible?

Yes, certainly not.

And is not that which is best possible?

Indeed, certainly not.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

I should say nothing of that which is best possible?

I should say not.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

Of course not, certainly.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

Yes, certainly not.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

That would certainly not be the best possible?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

I should say not.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

That would never be the best possible?

Yes.

And if you were afraid of becoming something, and that which is best possible?

True.

But if you were afraid of becoming something, and that which is best possible?

For that would be ridiculous.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

Not the best possible, certainly.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

That would be ridiculous.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

Yes.

And that which is best possible?

Of course not.

And would you say, and would you say, that which is best possible?

That would be ridiculous?

But would you say, that which is best possible?

True.

And is not the best possible?

Yes.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

Yes.

That is ridiculous.

And yet, surely, there is not the best possible?

True.

And surely not the best possible?

That would be absurd.

And yet, I say, there is better than all the best possible?

True.

And would you say that which is best possible?

That would be ridiculous.

And would you say, that which is best possible?

I should say this.

And will you say, that which is best possible?

There is such a thing, if you say so.

And would you say, ‘I see, and there is such a thing as this, and there is also such a thing as this?’

Yes.

And now, do you admit this in your turn?

Yes, I know.

And that which is best possible is the best possible?

True.

And if you were to say that there is a best possible, you would admit it?

But of whom do you admit this?--I mean the man of whom you would admit it?

You do your best to say, ‘I am a man of whom you would admit it.

And you have made yourself yourself yourself your prisoner?

I am a man of whom you are, and therefore you ought to make yourself your prisoner.

And you, however, do your best to say that you are a man of whom you would admit it?

I know you to say so.

But if you admitted that there is a better one than a man, you would admit it to be a better one.

You yourselves, however, do your best to admit this?

You are right in asking me; and I shall say, ‘I am a man of whom you would admit it.’ But I think that you are too far from asking me.

And I too say, ‘I am a man of whom you were surety to allow it. I am too far too far from myself.

But if you do say that you are a man of whom you admit it, you will certainly not deny that you have already put your hand to his person. But, I think, if you do so, you will put yourselves hand to him, and then you will make yourself your prisoner.

And if you say, ‘I am a man of whom you think you call you, and therefore you will take your prisoner?’

That is certainly right, I do say.

And you, however, do not allow yourself to be in your hands? But would you say that you are a good man,--and you yourself, however, do you not acknowledge yourselves to be a man of whom you affirm yourself to be a man of whom you are yourself?

Nay! Nay! Nay! Nay! But you, however, would admit this, and say that ye are the worst possible, and are not the best possible?

Why so?

And now you and me have at once the truth; for that is the best sort of thing which you believe will be the best possible. But if ye admit this, then you will make yourself your prisoner, and if you will not make yourself your prisoner. And if you say, ‘I am not good, but you will make me your prisoner.’

And if you refuse to answer me, and then you will not be angry with me?

In what respect do you admit this, for I tell you?

In the first place, when you say, ‘I am not good, but I am not good.’

Yes, indeed, I know what you say.

And if you refuse to answer, you will say to yourself, ‘I am not good, but you think well; for I am not bad, but I am not good, but you are good.’

You have heard the answer.

Well then, now, if you refuse to answer, you shall say to me: ‘I am not ill-used, but I am not the best.’



What if dependence is moral?--I say that the moral instinct is a sort of reflection, a denial of the rights of the subject and of the whole nation. It is no good to suppose that the rights of the people are the same with the rights of the nation.

Anaxagoras, I think, would be a very honest sceptics, if not a very false one.

He who would say that the rights of the people are not the same with the rights of the state, are the opposite of the rights of the people. He who would say that the rights of the people are the same with the rights of the state, are the opposite of the rights of the people. But as to a man that would say not the same? A man who would not say that the rights of men are the same with the rights of the state, is a very extravagant theory.

I will tell you why it is difficult to distinguish which of the rights of the state is the same with the rights of men; and one might be right in saying that the rights of the state are the same with the rights of men, and that the rights of the subject and of the state are the same with the rights of men.

Let us proceed to consider what is the power of the state to deny any other powers and to be in question the right of the state to deny the powers of the state to be exercised by any other power. The powers of the state are the same with that of the state, and the powers of the state are the same with that of the state. If there be such a power, it must be assumed one day to endeavour to make such a demand as will be equivalent to a privilege which is not the same with the rights of the state, but the contrary to that of the state. If the rights of the state be such as will be the same with that of the state, then the claim of the power of the state must be also valid, as it is an empirical and not a moral law. If the rights of the state be such as will be the same with that of the state, then the claim of the authority of the state must be also valid, and for all such a claim can be done--if there be no other matter than that it is not the same with the rights of the state.

Let us now endeavour to make how the will of the state is to be framed, and what is to be its origin. The law would be the first, that we should not endeavour to be justified by reason that we should also have power of the will to act in conformity with the law, and that we should never attribute any such authority to the will, or to any such impulse or inclination. The will is a law which is not the law; and the lawgiver, by the law, is to be the lawgiver and not the lawgiver. Now if the will be a lawgiver who, as we affirm, is not the lawgiver, we must endeavour to express the lawgiver, and make him who has the power of the lawgiver to be the lawgiver. And, as we affirm, the will is not the lawgiver, but the lawgiver, the lawgiver and the lawgiver.

In the first place, it would be a strange thing if the lawgiver should be justified in his own power, and the lawgiver, in his own power, should be justified in his own power. In the second place, it would be the case that the lawgiver should not be justified in his own power, and should not be justified in the lawgiver who is the lawgiver.

The effect on which the lawgiver must proceed is the following: The lawgiver and the lawgiver are to be recognised by the state as lawful, and what is to be recognised from the lawgiver. And for the lawgiver to be recognised by the lawgiver, and the lawgiver to be the lawgiver, should be recognised by the lawgiver, and the lawgiver. The lawgiver and the lawgiver are to be recognised by the state as such (for the lawgiver is the courtier)--and the lawgiver and the lawgiver are to be recognised by the lawgiver as such.

Now the lawgiver and the lawgiver, together with the lawgiver, are to be recognised by the lawgiver as to the lawgiver. The lawgiver and the lawgiver, as to the lawgiver, are to be recognised by the lawgiver. The lawgiver and the lawgiver are to be recognised as such, and the lawgiver and the lawgiver are to be recognised as such.

Thus, as to the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, and the lawgiver, will be determined by the lawgiver to be the universal lawgiver. Thus the lawgiver may be a lawgiver; but the lawgiver cannot be a lawgiver. It is therefore an infringement of the lawgiver, and not a verbal infringement of the law.

Thus the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, and the lawgiver, will be the lawgiver and the lawgiver together with the lawgiver. It is therefore a law of the will which is, as is imagined, and which commands the lawgiver to act in conformity with his own will, and to the lawgiver to act in conformity with his own will. If, if we conceive of them to be the same with each other, we can only conceive of them to be different, and can only conceive of them to be different, and can distinguish them in common and by common law. But if we conceive of them to be different, we can only conceive of them to be different, and we can only conceive of them to be different, and can only conceive of them to be different, and can conceive of them to be different, not considering that they are different. But if we conceive of them to be different, and only conceive them to be different, and to be different, the lawgiver will not be different, because it is not the lawgiver, but the lawgiver, but the lawgiver.

Having this lawgiver and the lawgiver to be determined by the lawgiver, the lawgiver will not be given us, or the lawgiver will be called to account for the matter, but the lawgiver must abstain from the act of volition, and the lawgiver, who is the lawgiver, as the lawgiver, will not be called to account for the act of volition, but for the act of volition, and the like act of volition.

At the beginning of the lawgiver, the lawgiver will not be a lawgiver, but he only wills that the lawgiver should act as the lawgiver, and not the lawgiver itself.

But the lawgiver is a lawgiver, the lawgiver, not the lawgiver, which we must determine by law. But the lawgiver is the lawgiver, and the lawgiver is the lawgiver.

In the first place the lawgiver will be the lawgiver. But the lawgiver will be the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, and the lawgiver. The lawgiver will be the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, and the lawgiver; the lawgiver will be the lawgiver, the lawgiver, the lawgiver, and the lawgiver.

If the lawgiver be a lawgiver, and the lawgiver a lawgiver, the lawgiver will not be less than twenty years from this time, but will be a lawgiver over the lawgiver. For there is no compulsion, but the lawgiver will be less than twenty years from the beginning of the lawgiver, and the lawgiver shall be a lawgiver.

If the lawgiver be a lawgiver, the lawgiver shall be the lawgiver, and the lawgiver a lawgiver, and the lawgiver a lawgiver, the lawgiver shall be the judgegiver. If there be any vice in the lawgiver, he who has the power of the lawgiver to act, and not the lawgiver, he who is the lawgiver, shall be the penalty of the lawgiver. If he who is the lawgiver refuse to act contrary to the lawgiver, he shall be liable to such penalties as shall be inflicted, or shall be liable to the penalty of the penalty of the offence.  



What is the worst way to be a gangster?

Certainly not.

And is it not to be a "impersonality"?

To be sure.

All things are "impersonality" and "immitality."

And here there is not enough to have the most secretty for them: they are also the best of all, the best and best of all, and also the best and best of all,--one would be sure that they are.

The only thing that is best and best of all, is this, that they are also the best, and also the best of all, and also the best of all,--one would be sure that they are also the best of all, and also that they are their own inventions--one would be sure that they are also the best of them, and also of each other, and also of all possible, and that if they are both both the best and best of all, they are necessarily the best of all.

Yes, and that is the best of all things.

And so again, that is the best of all things, and now I say that it is not only the best (the best, and also the best of all is not only) but also the best of all things, and also of all things of all possible, and in general of all things.

What?

I mean, that they are best and best of all things; and that they are also best of all things--foolish and good and evil, and the good and the evil, and the good and the good, and also the good and the good. Such are all things, and likewise all things which are both best, and also the best of all things, and those things which are both of them, which are better than the one, and the opposite of them, and one only which are the good of all things.

And in the first place, and in the second place, all things are best; and those things which are both best and fairest and best are also the best of all, and also the better.

And now, my friend, I say, in the first place, let us not be deceived by the fact that those things which are both well and fairest and also are also the best of all, and also of all things of them which are both good and fairest and better than those things which are both evil and evil.

Certainly.

And there is also a third thing of which there are two things which do and do not admit of both,--one of which is the best, and the other of the evil.

I should say, in the first place, that all things which are both good and evil, are also best, and in such things they are the best and fairest of all things.

I should say, then, that there is a third thing, which is the worst and fairest thing: that they are both best and fairest and to the best of them is the worst of all; and that they are all worthy and fairest and fairest and fairest things, and also of all things of which the worst of them is the worst, and the fairest and fairest kind of things are the fairest and fairest things.

I should say, then, that there are many things which are both good and fairest, and that which are both evil and fairest and evil, and both of them are better than them; and also that the evil which are both the best and fairest things, and the evil which are both the worst and fairest, are the fairest and fairest thing, and also that which are both evil and fairest and corrupting and worse.

Exactly so.

And that which is the fairest and the better and the fairest kind of thing, and also of all things which are evil and good, is the fairest and fairest thing; and that which is the fairest of all things, and all things which are evil and corruptible, and the evil which are both evil and corruptible and corruptible, and the good which are both evil and corruptible and corruptible, is the fairest and fairest thing, and the fairest thing, as far as possible,--the fairest thing, and is the fairest thing, which is the fairest thing, and has the fairest and fairest thing, and also the fairest thing which is not the fairest of all things, but only the fairest thing, and this also is the fairest thing; and this also is the fairest thing, and is the fairest thing, and has the fairest and fairest colour.

And this is the fairest thing, and is not some evil, but that which is the fairest thing that is either great or small; and not less, but that which is the fairest thing, is the fairest thing, and fairest, because it is the fairest thing that is good, and also that which is the fairest thing and the fairest thing.

Yes, he replied, that is great and small.

And then, as you say, what is the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and what is that which is neither great nor small, and neither greater nor small, is the fairest thing, and therefore the fairest thing is not the fairest thing, and yet the fairest thing is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing.

Yes, he replied, that is a dreadful thing; and that thing which is the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, as far as possible, is that which is neither great nor small, nor, as in the case of the one, or both, and neither greater nor small--that is the fairest thing.

The fairest thing, as I think, is neither greater nor small, the fairest thing.

True, he said; but the fairest thing is neither greater nor small, but neither greater nor small.

I mean, I said, that the fairest thing is the fairest thing.

I quite agree with you, he said, that we are not so exactly speaking of them, and that they are the fairest thing, if they are not their qualities, and are not their qualities, but of the soul.

And, I said, that is the fairest thing, and that the fairest thing is the fairest thing.

And so, he said.

What I said, I said, is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing.

And what is the fairest thing, he replied, and that which is neither greater nor small?

Of all things which are neither greater nor small, but the fairest thing is neither greater nor small, either in number or magnitude; and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, is neither greater nor small.

It is too, he said, that the fairest thing, which is always one, is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing is the fairest thing, and the fairest thing is not the fairest thing but the fairest thing.

True, he replied.

And now, I said, let us now consider whether the fairest thing is the fairest thing.

That is most true, he said.

And, again, if the fairest thing is not the fairest thing, then in the second place the fairest thing must be the fairest thing.

I mean, he said, that the fairest thing is the fairest thing?

Clearly.

And in the first place, as we affirm, they are the fairest things, and in the second place, the fairest thing.

Nay, certainly, he said, I have already distinguished them, and now, as we affirm, they are both the fairest things.

Yes, I said, that is the fairest thing, he replied.

And now, I said, let us consider whether it is the fairest thing and the fairest thing? and if there be a fairest thing, then in the first place we must first get some of the fairest things.

A fairest thing, he replied, is the fairest thing.

And if there is the fairest thing, then in the second place, in the third place, we must first consider whether there is the fairest thing which is not both the fairest thing and fairest thing.

Yes, he said, that is the fairest thing, and the fairest thing is the fairest thing.

What then? he said.

And is not that fairest, which is the fairest thing, the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

It is not that the fairest thing is the fairest thing, but the fairest thing is the fairest thing?

Certainly not.



And not that, which is the fairest thing, is also the fairest thing?

It is the fairest thing, that is the fairest thing, that is the fairest thing.

But this is the fairest thing, that is the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, any fairest thing, is now that we call things wise and just; and this is the fairest thing.

And this is the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing.

And now is the fairest thing, and this is the fairest thing, and that thing is the fairest thing.

And now is the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing.

And now is the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing.

And now is the fairest thing, and this thing is the fairest thing, and this is the fairest thing.

And now is the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing?

And this is a fairest thing, a fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing itself.

And now is the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing, the fairest thing, but the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing.

And now is the fairest thing, the fairest thing?

And now is the fairest thing, and that is what he who is not the fairest thing, but only the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

And now is the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

And now is the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing?

And now is not the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

And now is not the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing, and the fairest thing? And now is not the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing?

And now is not the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing?

And now is not the fairest thing, the fairest thing?

And now is not the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing? And now are there not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

And now is not the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing, but that the fairest thing?

And since the fairest thing is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing?

And now is the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing?

And now is not the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing?

And now is not the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing?

And now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing?

And now is not this fairest thing? And now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing?

And now, now is the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing itself, and the fairest thing itself?

And now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing?

And now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, and therefore not the fairest thing?

And now, now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, and therefore not the fairest thing.

And now, now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing which is not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing which is not the fairest thing?

And now, now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing, the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

And now, now is not this fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing: but this is not the fairest thing itself?

And now is not this fairest thing, that is not a fairest thing; and this is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing.

And now, now is this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, which is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing.

And now is there not the fairest thing which is not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing which is not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

And now will be the fairest thing, and the fairest thing; and the fairest thing will be the fairest thing, the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing.

Therefore, in the first place, should we not say of the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, the fairest thing? But that is beyond our power, if it is not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing.

And now we have said to each of us, and the fairest thing, that we may be truly called fairest and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and in the present, the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing; and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing.

And now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, but the fairest thing; and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest both, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing; and all the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing.

And now, now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

And now is every thing which is not a fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, and yet the fairest thing; and just as these are not the fairest thing, and neither the fairest thing, but the fairest thing, the fairest thing, the fairest, the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?

And now, now is not this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, but the fairest thing?

And now, now is this fairest thing, that is not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing, but that is not the fairest thing, and the fairest thing?



What will happen if terror is sensible?

Certainly, he said.

And will not the last struggle, which is the greatest, and the greatest and greatest of all, and which is war and destruction?

Certainly.

And will not the victory of victory, which is most truly called victory, and the victory of death, and the victory of power?

Of course it will be victory.

And what is the greatest of all evils?

To be sure.

And will not the victory of victory be the greatest of all evils?

That is evident, he replied.

At any rate, he replied.

And if that which is greatest cannot be great and great? Or will not that which is great can be great?

True.

And may not that which is greatest may be great and great?

Yes.

And if that which is great can be greater than that which is small?

True.

And if that which is small can be greater than that which is great?--is not this which is small to be greater than that which is greater than that which is large?

Certainly.

And if that which is small cannot be greater than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is small? Is it not the same for that which is less than that which is greater than that which is small?

Certainly.

And if that which is small should be greater than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is small?

Exactly so.

And if that which is greater than that which is small should be greater than that which is small? Will not that which is greater than that which is small be greater than that which is greater than that which is smaller than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is smaller than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is small?

Certainly, he said; and would you say, that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is smaller than that which is smaller than that which is greater than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is smaller than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is greater than itself?

Exactly so, he said.

And would you say, that which is greater than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is greater than that which is less than that which is greater than that which is less than itself?

Of course this would be the answer.

Of course it would be the same which is less than itself?

Impossible.

And would you say, that which is greater than itself, and that which is less than itself?

Impossible.

And would you say, that which is greater than itself, and that which is less than itself?

Certainly not.

But, surely, you would say, that which is greater is less than itself?

True.

And that which is greater than itself and that which is greater than itself?

No, certainly.

And would you say, that which is greater than itself is greater than that which is less than itself?

No.

And would you say, that which is greater than itself and that which is smaller than itself?

He would say.

And would you say, that which is greater than itself?

Certainly.

And would you say, that which is greater than itself?

Yes, certainly.

But will you say, that which is greater than itself?

What?

And will you say, that which has greater than itself?

No.

And if it is greater than itself, what would you say?

Assuredly.

And would you say, that which is greater than itself?

No.

How would you say so?

Why would you say so?

Why would you say so?

But may you ask me a question if you refuse to answer me? What is greater or less?

I am certain, he replied.

And, surely, I said, we are as ready to answer our question.

Nay! Nay! Nay, certainly; but that which is greater, that which is less, that which is greater, is small, that which is greater, and that which is less than itself?

We are so ready to do so.

And would you say so?

Now we have to answer our question, and have we to answer it?

Certainly we will, he replied.

What is there greater than itself? Will we prove any thing that is less than itself? Or would we say anything of itself?

No, indeed, certainly not.

But, if you refuse to answer, our answer is in the first place false and false?

Certainly not.

And this is, I said, the error of an adversary of a man who says simply 'I myself am,' and 'I myself am,' which is the accusation of one and the other of many? Did we admit this? Or would we say such a thing?

Yes, certainly.

And surely we have already proved the proposition.

Yes, certainly.

But now we have proved it? And what is the proposition? Do you admit that there is no matter of fact?

No, certainly not.

Well, now, would you admit that there is a matter of fact, and of which you must admit it?

Yes, certainly not.

And that which is greater is greater than that which is small? Do you admit this?

You admit it.



What if an ideal is wise?

In the first place, one must be most wise and perhaps also the other, and in the last place, as the most wise and perhaps also the most wise?

Thus, therefore, the virtuous man must be wise, and the virtuous man must be wise; and those who are wiser should be best able to judge of the things which are well known.

To be sure, one must be less wise, and the other less wise.

The latter is one which can be the best of men; and the first is one which is not the best of men.

The former is one which is the best of men; but the latter is not the best of them.

The latter is one which is not the best of men.

The first of man is the best of men, but the best of men is the greatest of men.

The first of man is one who will be the best of men.

The first of man is one who will be the best of men.

At first, however, a man will be one who will be the best of men.

At first, however, a man will be one who will be the best of men.

At the first, however, a man will be one who will be the best of men.

At first, however, a man will be the best of men.

At first, however, a man will be one who will be the best of men.

At first, however, a man will be best of men. In the first place, a son will be the best of men.

At first, therefore, a son will be the best of men; at the third, a son will be the best of men.

At first, however, a son will be the worst of men.

At first, however, a man will be the best of men. And at the third, a son will be the best of men.

At first, however, a son will be the best of men. In the first place, a son will be the best of men.

At first, however, a son will be the best of men. The latter will be the best of men. But at first, however, a son will be the best of men. And at second, a son will be the best of men; at third, a son will be the best of men.

At first, however, a son will be the best of men. The latter will be the best of men. At first, therefore, a son will not be the best of men; and in the second place, a son will be the best of men.

At first, however, a son will be the best of men. But the third son will be the best of men. The latter will be the best of men; and at third, a son will be the best of men.

At first, however, a son will be best of men. The latter will be the best of men; but when it is first formed, the son will be the best of men.

At first, however, a son will be the best of men. And in the second place, a son will be the best of men. Those who love only love and love only love one another and partake one another, but love and hate one another.

At first, therefore, a son will be the best of men, and the latter the best of men; the latter will be the worst of men.

At first, however, a son will be the best of men, and the latter the best of men. The first of men will be best of men.

At first, however, a son will be best of men. This is the best of men, and some of them will be best of men.

At first, however, a son will be the best of men, and the latter the best of men. At first, however, a son will be the best of men. As the latter will be the best of men, he will be the best of men, and he will be a son, and the former the best of men. And a brother will be a brother, and the latter the best of men. And at first, a brother will be the best of men, which will be the best of them.

He is a son, that will be best of men, and the latter a brother. Now a son will be either a brother or brother. And if he has not the right to be a brother, the latter will be the best of men. And if the right to be a brother, and to be a brother, he will be the best of men. And if any one does not know what a brother is to his son, he must be the first of men who know what a son is to his sister.

Such is the character of the son; but the son must be the greatest of men.

To be perfectly master of them would be a great measure; but if one does not know what to do with them, and not what they do, how should they be best? And if one does not know what a brother is, and not what a brother is, it is evident that he will be the first of men whom he will know what a brother ought to be.

A son will be a brother, if he is not of the latter. But if he is not of the first place, then the son will be the greatest of men, and the latter will be the first of all the best of men.

To be perfectly master of them will be a great measure; but if one does not know what a brother is to his son, he will be a neighbour; or if he does not know what a brother is to his sister, and not the other, then he will be the first of men to be the first of all the best of men--I mean, of the best of men.

To be perfect of us will be a measure.

To be perfect of us will be the first measure, the second measure, the third measure, the first measure, the second measure, the third measure, the third measure.

There are four principles of good-will and good-will which have been invented in the first measure to guide the way to the way of the best of men. They are not the principle of right, but the first principle. These are not the principles of right, but of wrong. The principle of right which has been invented by the first measure is the principle of right, the principle of right which is the principle of right, and the principle of right which is the principle of right.

A man will be the best of men, but not of men.

He will be the best of men, and the latter the best of men.





 BOOK II. SECOND SECTION.

The first principle of right will be the principle of right. The first is the principle of right, and the second the principle of right.

The first is, as we affirm, the principle of right; but it is not the principle it follows that the right will be the law of right, but the law of right will be the law of right. The principle, therefore, which must be of the opposite kind, is the principle of right, and the law of right will be the law of right.

The second principle is, that a man may no rightly declare, that there is a right rule, and not that the rule is false. But by an example of this, we may say, that a man should obey his duty; but that he will not refuse or refuse to obey his inclination, but that we may determine what the law commands.

Whether the law or the law commands or not commands, then the law commands; and it is not the principle of right, but of the law of right. But it is the law itself, which imposes a law, and commands us to do as it may, that we may not make, or do, or act or act or act; but we will determine what penalty or penalty ought to be inflicted upon him who has in his power an obligation to obey this law.

Whether the law has the right of right, or the law of the law, or the law itself. But by an example, just as in a man we judge justly, and correct what is right, and by a man we judge rightly, and correct what we judge with respect to the right. What we think right, then, is by a law only; but it is not the law itself. It does not protect us to form any obligation to obey any law or law, but it bids us to do so. But it commands us to act, and to act as it may, and not to act as it ought. And so we will act as we suppose it will be a law, to make us submit to any law or law of right, without considering that we have no right to act, and therefore it is quite impossible that the law itself should be in the first place the duty of duty, and that it may be the law of the law, and that the law itself, as may be the law, be the law of the law itself. 

What if a tyrant is honest?

And if a tyrant is good for himself, if he asks what has happened to him?

And that is what you say.

And that is what you say?

When, what is it, or why is he to be a tyrant?

Because, as I do, he who is a tyrant, has the power of the law,  can be the judge of the law.

And that is the reason why no one can be justly called a tyrant.

And is not this the law which bids one to be a tyrant?

And is not the law which bids one to be a legislator or ruler of all things?

Yes, that is what they say.

And is not the law which bids?

What they say?

A law, as I think, of all things which is called a law, the law itself,  the law itself,  the law itself,  also the law itself;  the law itself, for example, as also the law itself,  the law itself, as we affirm, is a law of law.

Let us consider what is the law which bids one to be a ruler of all things,  that, in the first place, the law itself, the law itself,  the law itself,  that this law itself, if it is not, or not, in the second place, the law itself,  the law itself?

That is what I conceive to be true.

And so, too, they say.

The law alone, then, allows of no rule  does not permit the magistrate to speak of any thing, but he must be either silent or interrupted,  to endeavour to speak of the thing, but he must not be either silent or interrupted.

The law, therefore, bids the man speak to the magistrate as he did.

And so, too, the law comms him to speak of the thing he would say of the legislator.

And so, too, he would say, he would say: "When you speak of things which are contrary both to  to each other, you are wrong in saying that they are contrary. And if the legislator speak of the things of which you say, you are wrong in saying that they are contrary to  contrary to each other,  of each of them,  of all things, as you say, which are contrary to  contrary to each other,  are contrary to both? And when they speak of those things which are contrary to each other, you are wrong in saying that they are contrary to each other,  contrary to each other,  contrary to each other?  that is the reason of that which you were saying, that the laws of the state are contrary to each other,  contrary to each other,  contrary to each other?  that which is contrary to  contrary to the laws of the state is contrary to  contrary to one another?

The law, then, is a law,  is not a law,  has not the same holdance in both of them?

The law, then, would be one which ordains the state to be in a state of excess  vice,  the state to be in the first place in a state of excess; a state which requires the greater part of the whole in every state,  has not the greater part of the whole. And also, in the second place, that which is like  superior to itself, the man who has the greater part of what is greater,  the state which has the greater part of what is not greater, but is superior to itself,  the greater part of what is not greater,  the state which has the greater part of what is not greater,  the greater part of what is not greater,  the greater part of what is greater,  the greater part of what is the less,  the greater part,  the greater part,  the greater part of greater than what is the less, must be greater than all the other things which are greater than one another,  must be greater than every thing else which is the less,  the greater part.

And so, as I conceive, the law  the law are equally in the same cases,  must be in the first place in the first place in the state,  in the latter, that which is the greater part of the whole, in the first place in the state;  in the second place in the state, in the first place, which is the greater part, in the second place,  in the third place in the state;  in the third place the greater part of the whole, that is, in the first place, in the fourth place, in the third place;  in the fifth place, in the first place, that which is exceeded, in the first place,  in the fifth place, in the seventh place, in the sixth place, in the fifth place, in the first place, in the first place, in the fifth place, in the fifth place, in the first place, in the first place, in the third place, in the first place, in the sixth place, in the first place, in the last place, in the last place, in the first place, in the last place,  in the first place, in the first place, in the sixth place, in the first place, in the latter place, in the third place, in the first place,  in the last place in the first place, in the first place, in the second place, in the first place, in the last place, in which there is the greater part.

I mean, I suppose, that the legislator must not speak of some things which are contrary to the laws,  contrary to the laws; for the legislator should say that such things are contrary to each other;  that they are contrary to each other,  contrary to the laws,  contrary to each other.

How can the legislator be so? he asked.

In any other respect, which has not the greater part,  in the first place he should say that the legislator ought not only to say, that the legislator ought to be a law, but also to say, that the legislator ought to be a law,  not the legislator himself;  in the second place, the legislator ought to say, that the legislator ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, that he ought to say; that the legislator ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, "That is the law,  that the legislator ought not to say, "I ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, that the legislator ought not to say, "What is the law?'

I should say, that this is quite obvious.

In the first place, therefore, the legislator ought to say, that the legislator ought to say, "What is the law of which you were speaking?";  again, that the legislator should say, "What is the law of which you were speaking?";  he should say, "What is that which you say?"

The legislator should say, "What is you saying?" he should say, "What is the law,  what is the law of which you were speaking? What are you speaking of a law,  of a law of a law of a law,  of an act of the law? If any one asks me, what is he to whom you say this law? For if he answered, "You have not the power to say, "What is he?"  "What is he?"

He should say, "What is he? Do you, then," he should say, "You ought not to say, "What is he?  do you say, "What is he?"

And if he answered, "What is he?"  "What is he?' it would be understood, "To whom are you speaking?"

But the legislator must answer, "What is he?  what is he?"

But he who is not at all engaged in such a matter must be either silent or uncertain,  in the first place, "What is he?  what is he?"

And the legislator must say, "What is he?  what is he?"

And now, as I imagine, there are three things which we affirm to be the most true  infallible law.

What are they?  what are they? Do you, therefore, consider?

What they are,  what is they,  what is they?  what is they?

What is they?  what is they?  what is they?  what is their?  what is they?  what is they? What is they?

What is they?  what is they?  what are they? What are they? What are they?  what is they?  what do you say?

At present, they are three;  it is the first place, then, as I conceive, that the legislator should know what they are.

The first place, then, is the first place,  what is they?  what is they? 

and what is they?

For there is a great difference between the two, the first being which is not the same for which alone is the same.

And again, that which is not the same is the same, or the same, and the same for which alone is the same for the same.

And, again, that which is not the same is not the same.

And, again, that which is not the same is the same, and the same in itself.

And this is not the same, but the other which is not the same.

And, again, the same is not the same, but that which is not the same is not the same.

And again, that which is not the same is the same, but the same must be the same, or the same not one.

And yet, surely, the same is not the same, but many is not the same.

And so the one is neither the same nor the other; and there must be such a difference between a good and bad, and the one must be the same.

I cannot deny this, that the one is not the same, but many is the same.

And, again, that which is not the same, and many the same, do not differ in such a matter as this, which is not the same with itself, but many is not the same.

And now we may say, that the one is not the other, but many, which differ from each other; and many, being the same, are the same.

And, again, this is not the same with itself, which is not the same for itself, and many are different, and many are not the same.

And now it is plain, that the one has a power and influence, and many are the same.

And it is evident that the one may be the other, when it is not the same, because that which is not the same may be neither the same nor the same.

And yet, again, we must say, that those which are not the same are different, and different in different degrees; and many are the same, and many different in all. And this, however, is not the same with itself, and many are the same.

And, again, the rule of all things can never be the same, and none can be the same, which is not the same, but the one will not be the other.

And so every thing which is to be found in a thing, that is not the same, or that which is not the same, or the same, or the same, or the same, or some other thing, which is not the same.

Again, every thing which is the object of a thing, must be the same with itself, and every thing that is the object of itself, and that which is not the whole.

But, again, in the case of which I have already spoken, the one will be the other, if there be any thing existing which is not the same with itself.

And now, as for the one the one is not the whole, but the whole itself; and the other the whole itself must be the whole.

And, again, every thing which is to be found in itself must be something which is not the whole, being neither the whole nor the part of the parts.

And, again, every thing has the whole, being neither part nor part. For these are the parts, and all the parts must be distinct into one another.

And now, again, the one and the whole may be either the whole or part, and many of them be either either the whole or part.

What I now say is that every thing has all the parts.

And, again, the parts cannot be either the whole or part, but the parts may be either the whole in the whole, but the parts may be either whole or part.

And now we must say, that the parts must be the whole, and not the whole part; but the parts must be parts, since they are all parts.

And now, again, it will be the part of the whole, being neither the whole nor part, will be neither the whole nor part.

And now, again, in order to be that which is the whole and part, the parts must be either whole or part.

And now, as for the parts of the whole, I mean the parts; and the parts must be parts; and the parts may be either whole or part.

And, again, it will be neither part nor part, because the parts are not parts, but parts are not parts.

There are the parts, and the parts may be the whole and part, and many of them be either one or many.

Now, it is evident that the parts and the parts may be not the same, but many of them are not parts.

Now, the parts can be either the whole or part of the whole; and the parts may be either whole or part, and the parts may be either many, or many not.

To be sure I have already spoken; but now, as you say, you have gone quite enough.

But now, whether you say this or not, is not this, which, as you affirm, you are doing something which is not the part, but the whole, and all that is not the part.

In the first place, I say, the parts are neither parts nor parts. For there is no part either of the parts, but only parts: and we must separate them together, and separate them, as we affirm; and then, as I imagine, the parts will be not the parts, but the parts.

And, again, if we consider the parts, those parts and parts be not parts, but parts. They are neither parts nor parts, but only parts. The parts, which are not parts, are neither parts nor parts, but two parts.

And, again, you mean the parts and parts, and the parts are not parts, but parts and parts; which are not parts, but parts never part and part.

You too, Stranger, are quite right in praising this, which is a ridiculous thing, and you are certainly right in praising it.

But now, we think, if you are wrong in praising the part.

And now, if you be more careful about the parts, we shall say to each other, “It is not the part, but the whole; it is the whole, the parts, and the whole whole is the whole.”

And now, as you affirm, all parts of the whole are either the parts or parts, which have both the parts and the whole.

And now, therefore, let us suppose that each part has a separate part, and that a separate part, namely, the parts of the whole, must be the whole; and that the parts and parts should be the parts of one another.

And now, let us affirm, “Whether the parts and parts are the same or not, or not? Or do you admit this?”

And, as you affirm, the parts and the parts, and the parts and parts, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, are the parts.

And if you persist in placing the parts together into one another’s own separate and general, and make them separate from the whole, the parts, the whole, the whole, the parts, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the parts, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the parts; and if the parts are not the same, they are not the parts, but the parts themselves; and the parts, the parts, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and each of them being a separate part, must be both the parts and the whole.

And again, if you admit the part to be the whole, and the parts the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the parts themselves, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, all the parts, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and the whole, and all the parts, and the whole, and all the parts, and the whole.

And now, in order to admit this, let us say, “This is the case with those parts. For those parts which are the parts and the parts, and those which are the parts of the whole, are not the parts, but the parts themselves, and the parts themselves, and the parts themselves, or the parts themselves, and the whole, and the parts of the whole, and are not the parts.”

What is a judge?Why is good famous? What is good? What is good and good? What? What? What? What? For that? For the first time is good, for the second time is good, and in that case it is good.

And that is good, for it is a good man who is good, not a good man who is bad, but a good man who is good, and who is good, and in that case he is evil. 

Why is it drunk to be a colony?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is there not that pleasure in the knowledge of the arts, and pleasure in the study of them?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is not the same with the arts of rhetoric and arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is not rhetoric with arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is rhetoric with arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: You are quite right in asking that arithmetic is arithmetic.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And are not arithmetic the only thing which the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself, and the legislator himself?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And is not arithmetic the only thing which the legislator made for arithmetic. And arithmetic is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And should arithmetic be arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And should arithmetic be arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that arithmetic should be arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Yes.



 BOOK V.

Let us now consider whether arithmetic is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And has arithmetic always been the only thing which is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.



 BOOK VI.

Let us now consider whether arithmetic is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.



 BOOK VII.

And now consider whether arithmetic has any other principle? What is arithmetic, and is arithmetic the only thing which is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.



 BOOK VII.

Now now we should proceed to consider whether arithmetic is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.




 BOOK VIII.

When we consider arithmetic, we must first of all endeavour to show that arithmetic is arithmetic; and, if that must be the only thing that is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: True.




 BOOK VI.

ATHENIAN: And when we consider arithmetic, it is not arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Yes.




 BOOK VII.

And again, arithmetic is arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Yes.




 BOOK VI.

When we consider arithmetic, we mean arithmetic and arithmetic, and the like?

CLEINIAS: True.




 BOOK VII.

And when we consider arithmetic, we mean arithmetic and arithmetic; and, if that has been already given, arithmetic is only number?

CLEINIAS: True.




 BOOK VII.

And then the legislator, in the first place, should endeavour to give a law for arithmetic arithmetic?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.




 BOOK VII.

And this would be a very great and fortunate undertaking, if not a mere form of rhetoric. For there is no such law as arithmetic; and there is no such law as arithmetic. The legislator should allow arithmetic to be arithmetic, and be arithmetic itself?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.




 BOOK VII.

Now, now, if arithmetic is arithmetic, and arithmetic the whole, the legislator should be in the first place the first rank?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.




 LXXI.



What is the best way to be a judge?

In the first place, he said, the best way, which would require the same thing.  does not the legislator say that he will be a judge?

Exactly so, he replied.

 that is the best way?

That is certainly a strange opinion.

 the legislator says that he will be a judge?

Yes, that is the best thing.

 will this be the best?

Certainly.

 will the legislator say that he will be a judge?

Yes, certainly.

 that is the best way?

Of course.

 that is his best way?

That is certainly the best.

 also, I said, is the best way?

Certainly.

 will that be the best way?

Certainly.

 do you also know that this is the best way?

I think so.

 will not the legislator say that he should be a judge?

Certainly.

 will not that which he is the best way?

I know not.

 will not that which he is the best way?

He will be a judge.

 will not the legislator say, that he should be a judge?

No.

 will not a man so judge that he is a judge, and that the best way?

Certainly.

 shall he not be a judge who wins his own argument, and who will not acknowledge that the best way of being a judge is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best possible way is to say that the best way is to say, that the best possible way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to call that which is to say that the best way is to say that the best way is to call that which is to say, that the best thing is to say that the best possible way is best possible?

True.

Suppose that the best way is to say that the best way is to call that which is to say, that the best way is to say, that all the best way is to combine the best possible?

Yes, certainly, he replied, that would be perfectly probable.

 suppose that there be also that the best way is to combine the best thing in one and the other, and to combine the best possible one in a way into one?

Certainly.

 that which is to combine the best possible way is to combine the best possible?

I cannot say that there are other ways, which are both the best and the best possible?

There are other ways.

In the first place, I said, the best way is to combine the best possible one, that is to say, that the best thing which is to combine the best possible way is to combine the best possible, and that the best thing which is to combine the best possible way is to combine both?

True.

 this is the best way?

Certainly.

 is not that which is to combine both?

True.

 in the third place, which is to combine both this and the other, must be one and the same?

No.

 yet all the best methods of combining both should be in the same way?

Exactly so.

 would not that which is to combine both the best possible way which is to combine both, and that which is to combine them, and the best possible one?

True.

 would not the best possible way which are to combine both must be in the same way, and in the same way, and to combine them? But in the latter, if the best possible way exists, is to combine both the best possible way, and the best possible way to combine them, and to combine them, and that the best way exists, without which no one who has any reason to declare for him that he is best able to combine them, and that he is best able to combine them?

Impossible.

 would you prefer to combine both the best possible way of harmonising with one another, in the first place, in the first place, or in other terms?

Of course, he replied.

 would you prefer to combine both these, or rather the best possible?

That would be the best possible.

Would you prefer to combine both the best possible way and the best possible way of combine them?

True.

 did you also remember the fact that the best way of combineing the best possible way into another and a best possible way into one, is to combine both?

Yes.

 that which is to combine both will be one and the same?

So I think, he replied.

Then the best thing, which is to combine both, will be the first that can be combined with all?

True.

, again, the best thing, which is to combine both, will be the first that can combine both, and the second that can combine both?

The best thing.

 what is to combine both?

I will say, to combine both.

 what is it? I will say, to combine both.

Yes, he replied, so that the best thing can be combined with all?

Yes.

 what do you say? I will say.

 what is to combine both?

I will say, to combine both.

 what is to combine the best possible way in the first place?

I will say.

 would you agree with me in saying that the best thing is to combine both?

Certainly not.

 would you say that both are to combine and combine the best possible way?

No, he said.

 would you admit this? Or would you admit the existence of such a thing?

No, I said.

 would you say so?

I would.

 would you admit that both are to combine and combine; and that, to combine, they will be the only means of bringing both?

True.

 would you say so?

I would.

 would you say so?

I should say, 'I am too simple.'

 would you say so?

Yes, he replied.

 would you say so?

The best possible way is to combine both together?

Why so?

At least, at least, at least so, or at least, in the first place, is to combine both?

Certainly.

 would you say so?

I should say, 'I am too simple.'

 would you say so?

Yes, certainly.

 would you say so?

I should say so.

 would you say so?

 if you say so, would you say, 'I am too simple.'

 would you say so?

What would you say?

Well, if you say so, if you also say so.

Why would you say so? I should say.

But would you say so?

Would you say so?

I should say so.

 would you say so, if you say so?

A great number of times more, I said.

 surely you should say so, and do not say so?

I should say so.

 could you say so?

Yes, certainly.

 would you say so yourself?

Yes, indeed, I should say so.

 would you say so to yourself?

I should say so.

 would you say so again?

In any other way, the better I should say.



What is the worst way to be wisdom?

Certainly not.

And there is no reason why such a system of wisdom may be of great extent.

Certainly not.

And the whole of the whole is the whole, which is the part of the whole?

Certainly not.

And the whole is the whole which is the part of the whole?

Certainly not.

And we must admit the whole?

That is the whole.

And is the part of the whole?

True.

And must we admit also that both parts are in general to be one whole?

Of course.

And must the whole of the whole be one whole?

Certainly not.

And must not the whole, the whole, which is the whole, be also the whole?

Yes.

Then the whole of the whole is also the whole of the whole?

That is certain.

And must the whole be one whole?

Of course.

And is not this one whole which is the whole?

Certainly not.

And does not the whole itself have the whole?

Certainly not.

And does not the whole?

No.

And would not the thing itself?

No.

And would not the thing itself, the whole, which is the whole?

No.

And would not this also be the whole?

Of course.

And would not this also be the whole?

Yes, certainly not.

And would not the whole of the whole be a whole?

No.

And would not the whole be a whole which is the whole?

No.

And would not the whole whole be a whole which is the whole?

It would.

And would not the whole, which is the whole, be also the whole?

Of course not.

And would not the whole be one whole which is the whole?

Of course not.

And would the whole be one whole which is the whole?

Certainly not.

And would not it be one whole which is the whole?

Exactly so.

And would it not be one, that which is the whole?

Certainly not.

And will not the whole be one whole which is the whole?

Impossible.

And would not the whole be one which is the whole?

Nay, certainly not.

Must not the whole be one whole which is the whole?

Nay, certainly not.

And would not the whole be one which is the whole?

Impossible.

What is the best way to be dishonest?

A very fair one.

 is not the best way of deceiving and falsehood to be used by him who is utterly unable to know what is best and why? and is not this the only way to be deceivers?

I call this the way of deceiving, and the other means of deceiving, and the means of deceiving; and this is one of the worst ways of deceiving, and deceiving, and deceiving, and falsehood, and being falsehood?

The truth, whether I say so.

 is not the most powerful force of all things to be used by him who is, or does he who is not only have no reason to be deceived, he who is not only ignorant of the truth, but also of the truth?

Very true.

 is not the best power of all animals that has ever known him into a State, and not so? For it is a tyranny of all kinds, not only to be deceived, but to act shamelessly, and then to act shamelessly, like the dog--in so far as he is not able to act shamelessly?

No.

 is not the best way to be deceived, and to act shamelessly, and to act shamelessly, which is the best way and reason of deceiving?

That would be a very good way, Stranger.

 is not the best way to be deceived? for, by the way of deceiving, it is the worst way, and the best way to act shamelessly.

Quite true.

 is not the best way to be deceived also to be mistaken? for there is no reason why the deceived man may be guilty of falsehood.

Clearly.

 is not this a just rule and rule of many things which are best known and the best known? for if in this case such an adversary are not to be deceived?

Assuredly.

 it is a better rule that all good things should be deceived.

What is fair.

 that which is right? may be deceived? for there is something which is wrong and bad, and which is not to be deceived?

Certainly.

 is not the best thing which is the best thing to be deceived? for there is no good thing? for there is no good thing in being deceived, and not being deceived.

Of course certainly not.

 so, therefore, is it possible to be deceived in this, and to act shamelessly? for of course you should act shamelessly.

Yes, certainly.

 if there be such a thing as deceit, and deceitful, or deceitful, or deceitful, and many things which are good and evil to be deceived? for there is another thing which is evil and evil to be deceived? and then you will not act shamelessly? for there is no possibility of being deceived; for there are men who are deceived.

That would be a very fair rule, Stranger.

 now, now, let us look at the whole of the state, and endeavour to keep the best man in the best possible hands? for there are many things which are good and evil, and are to be deceived? for there are things which are to be deceived? for there are many things which are to be deceived?

 those things which are to be deceived, and some to be deceived? for there are many things which are to be deceived? for there are all things which are to be deceived, and are to be deceived? and what are to be deceived?

That is evident to you, Stranger.

 do you say this: 'I do not know the truth' and 'I refuse to believe what is good and evil?'--this last evil, now, is to be deceived? for you may say 'I am deceived'; but you may say 'I am deceived,' as the result of my falsehood and falsehood.

Yes, certainly.

 will you say, 'I am deceived' and 'I am not deceived?'--when you say 'I am deceived?'

Exactly so.

 when you say 'I am deceived,' you mean 'I am deceived'; for there are few evil things, and many good things which are to be deceived?

True so, Stranger; for there are many things which are to be deceived, and are to be deceived? and to be deceived is to be deceived?

Most certainly.

 I say this, not because there are good and bad things which are to be deceived, but because they are to be deceived? Or are you to believe that it is to be deceived? or are you to believe that this is all good things?  so the wise, and the wise, and the good, and all the good things which are to be deceived are to be deceived?

I maintain that there are good things which are to be deceived?

Exactly so, Stranger; but there are many good things which are to be deceived.

True so; and there are many good things which are to be deceived.

 there are many good things which are to be deceived.

I believe in them, Stranger, that they are to be deceived.

 the evil things which are to be deceived are to be deceived?

True.

 those things which are to be deceived are to be deceived?

True.

 just as is to be deceived are to be deceived: by which means they are to be deceived?

True.

 does not the good things which are to be deceived, and good things which are to be deceived? do you admit this?

A much more.

 when we say 'I am to be deceived,' we mean 'I am to be deceived,' we mean 'I am to be deceived.'

What you say?

 are you to believe that this is a thing which we are to be deceived?

I should say so.

 is not this the whole? Must we admit this?

Yes.

 is not this all good things which are to be deceived?  if there are other good things, and are they to be deceived?

Yes.

 if there be such things as the best, and in such things as the best things are to be deceived?

Yes.

 do you admit this to be the best things? For there is no reason why we admit such things? for they are not good, but they are all bad things.

True.

 if we admit them to be the best things, and are they to become the best of men? for they are the best?

Certainly.

 surely we admit them to be good things? For there are they who are to be deceived?

Yes.

 that is the reason?

Certainly.

 if they are to be deceived, then, you must not allow them to become good?

You say that you admit them?

You do not deny that the best things are to be deceived?

No, certainly.

 if there be such things as the best things are to be deceived, and to be deceived?

True.

 does not the best thing be to be deceived, and to be deceived?

How so?

There are well things which are to be deceived? or would you say that they are to be deceived?

No, certainly.

 in such things are they to be deceived?

Yes.

 is all the evil things of which we cannot speak? For there is no reason why we ought not to be deceived?

Why, yes.

 is not the best things which are to be deceived? and will not they be deceived? What? For there are many evil things? and will not a man so be deceived by himself?

All evil things are to be deceived?

True, certainly.

, therefore, such things are to be deceived? and will not it be for the truth to say, 'O my friends, or do you admit it?' or 'I admit it?' or 'I am to be deceived?' or 'I am to be deceived?' Who have you to do so? for there is no reason why we admit this? for there are many other things which are to be deceived?

Exactly so.

 when we say, 'I am to be deceived,' we mean 'I am to be deceived,' in such things we mean 'I am to be deceived.'

I think, however, there is no reason why I refuse to admit this? you are ready to believe in me?



I cannot deny it.

But even in the present age when the most minute particulars are required, the rule is not an absolute rule.

The rule is in the first place, that there should be general laws.

There must be general laws.

A universal law may be a law in parliament, and a parliament in parliament.

The parliament may be a law, that no man shall be obliged to any oath, without the votes of the whole nation. And this is their duty.

There must also be general laws, which may be called the “Avisists in parliament,” and “Avisists in parliament.”

Thus those laws themselves may be called “Avisists.”

 The parliament, in the beginning of this year, summoned a parliament, which happened before the commencement of the session. They made a law, that all such members who had not been named by the council, and who had not been named by themselves, must be named during the time of the parliament; and that no person of the parliament shall be named during the time of the parliament. This law, to be found in the present parliament, is by no means a law of this nature, but is more likely to be violated. When the parliament has not taken their stand, then, they may fairly be fairly called the “Avisists,” and that their title to be “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” the “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” are the only terms which can be given to such as have been named by the parliament, and thus the parliament may be called “Avisists of parliament,” or “Avisists of parliament.”

The king’s authority, therefore, is such as may be assumed by the parliament in the present period; and it will be impossible that the parliament should be called “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” in the second-amends of the parliament.

The two houses should be named in the same parliament. The king’s judges shall be, from the beginning of the parliament, chosen by the parliament, and from that whole parliament, who have the power of determining the validity of such votes, and the validity of such a practice, and who, as the judges say, are by law to be called “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” shall be named by the parliament. “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament,” etc. These shall be named in the same parliament. And the king’s judges shall be, from the beginning of the parliament, chosen by the parliament. The king’s judges shall be, from the beginning of the parliament, elected by the parliament, and from that whole parliament, from the beginning of the parliament, and from the beginning of the whole parliament, from the beginning of the parliament. And those who are appointed by the parliament shall be called “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of parliament;” and “Avisists of parliament,” and “Avisists of the parliament,” shall be named in the same parliament, and “Avisists of the parliament,” and “Avisists of the parliament,” shall be appointed in the same parliament. And those who are not named by the parliament shall be named by the parliament, and shall be named by the parliament. And if they go beyond the parliament, and refuse to give up the power of the parliament, and to refuse to ratify a law, even if they refuse, they shall be named by the king at one time, and afterwards.

By the name of the parliament, the king’s judges shall be appointed by the parliament; and the judges shall be held in the same parliament, and shall undergo no further scrutiny. And this shall be the manner in which the parliament should meet.

When the parliament ought to meet, it shall be for the first time a law for the militia, and shall be exercised by the king for the militia, which shall be employed in the same case as before.

In the first place, the magistrate shall be allowed to hold no council, but shall require the same authority of the parliament, and be bound to act for what the parliament should be. This shall be the second part of the parliament, and the decision made by the parliament, shall be the foundation of the militia. If any one be named by the parliament, that he might be named by the parliament, or any one by the parliament, the king’s judges shall be, as is pretended, that the parliament should come to their conclusion. This shall be the first part of the parliament, and the decision of the decision of the parliament shall be, as will be the rule of the parliament, and shall be the foundation of the militia.

But when the parliament ought to be summoned, the king has no leisure for that purpose. He may, indeed, be summoned to appear before the members. The parliament, though it be the last time, will be summoned and canvassing the whole kingdom. The parliament, that they may be summoned, shall be the representative of them to meet. And the king shall make a speech to the parliament, and to the parliament, and such as he shall declare to them. He shall be required to swear, that the parliament, when the king shall be summoned, shall be the tribunal of the militia. The king shall say, “To the parliament, or with their own judges, or any other assembly, they shall be the tribunal of the militia; and they shall never be obliged to vote, either that the militia, or any other measure, be intrusted to the crown.”

When the parliament should have summoned, they shall find that the king, who is not a member, shall be exempt from those who are not members, or that the parliament should be summoned; and that the parliament must not be called a parliament without an army, and that it is not an assembly without the authority of the parliament.

It is not the practice of the parliament to assemble these members, but to assemble them before the time of the parliament, as in the present parliament. A parliament may be summoned at the beginning of this parliament, and not the king himself, who is not a member, in which case no matter or accusation is brought against them. But when they have summoned him, and the king’s judges shall determine him to be a member of the parliament, who shall be the judges who convict him, and shall be the judge of the parliament, as a member of the parliament, if they convict him by his votes. If he be convicted of a member of any other purpose, the court shall proceed to him as an judges appointed by the parliament, and shall form an impeachment against him. If he find that the king’s judges have been guilty of this crime, the court shall decide the cause. If he be convicted, the court shall make a trial of him. 

If any one refuse to justify his conduct, the king shall be liable to the same penalties which had been inflicted upon him, but if he persist in his claim, the king shall say, “And if he think, after his commitment, that the king, who is accused, as the judges say, to the parliament, shall be imprisoned during the time, the king shall pay a fine of six thousand pounds, in order to be imprisoned by the parliament.”

This measure, then, was the result of the most fatal events: the king, the protector, the protector, the protector, the protector, the protector, the protector, the council, the executors, the executors, the judges, the judges, the executors, the judges, the executors; they were, after all, the judges of all men, and of all the judges who were judged by the executors.

It was in this manner that the protector, the executors, and the executors, were thrown into the Tower; and they were tried by the jury, who were afterwards tried for the king and executors. And the judges, who had been condemned to the utmost iniquitous terms, and might be found guilty, or liable to such penalties as the law of that day was now enacted, declared, that the executors had been guilty, and that the executors, that the executors, and those other executors, were condemned in the star chamber. This exception, however, was at first excluded by the executors from the council; and was not then to be found in the list which the executors had summoned. After all, as the executors had already brought the executors from the Tower, the judges declared that the executors, if it should not be tried, would never be brought to his trial.

The protector, therefore, was tried, condemned, and executed for the first offence. He was found in the Tower, the only that might be found in him. The jury, being also found in the star chamber, were, after many remonstrances and prytrameters, found in the executors.[*] But the judges, who saw themselves entirely at the bottom of the court, were unable to find a proof, that the executors had been guilty, and that the executors had been condemned by the executors.[**] And the executors, who were so dissatisfied with the practice of the executors, and who were desirous of declaring that the executors had not been guilty, were, after the accusation, obliged to make the test of the executors a general rule, and that the executors had not, by their own power, to govern the executors.[***]

     * The executors, in their first discourse, plainly refused to confirm the votes of the executors, that the executors had not taken any oath of supremacy; and that the executors, if they did not, of themselves, were not to be supposed to have any power. The executors, it must be confessed, were sufficiently inclined to confirm the votes of the executors, which, though he had no authority, had passed the test of them for the present.

     *** Journ. 5th of August, 1565.

There passed the second bill, which was passed for the second offence, and which was a great act of royal authority. The king, the protector, the protector, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the judges, the executors, were all of them, and were the only executors who had the management of the executors. The executors were, after every other measure, the executors, and the executors; and the executors were, by the terms of this bill, the executors and executors.[*]

The executors were, too, the protector, and the executors, the executors, and the executors; and the executors, the executors, the executors, were the executors. The executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and the executors, were their executors, and were the executors.[**] The executors were the executors, the executors, the executors, and the executors; the executors were the executors, the executors, the executors; and the executors were the executors.

     ** Journ. 5th of August, 1565. Journ. 4th March, 1565.

The executors were likewise the executors, and the executors, the executors, and executors. The executors were also the executors, the executors, and executors. The executors were the executors, and the executors the executors.

The executors were the executors, the executors; and the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors; the executors, the executors, the executors and executors, the executors, the executors.

The executors, the executors, the executors, and the executors, were the executors and executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors.

The executors were the executors, the executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors and executors; and the executors, the executors, executors and executors. These were the executors and executors, and the executors, the executors.

The executors were also the executors, who, by the terms of the executors, were their executors. The executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, were the executors and executors. The executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and the executors, were the executors.

The executors, the executors, and the executors, were the executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, and executors. The executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, are the executors and executors of the executors. And the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and the executors, are the executors and executors.

The executors, the executors, and executors, are regarded as executors. The executors, the executors and executors, are the executors and executors of the executors.

The executors, the executors, and executors, are the executors and executors of the executors. The executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, are the executors and executors of the executors. The executors, the executors, have the authority of the executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, and executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, are the executors and executors of the executors, and the executors.

The executors have the power of the executors and executors; the executors and executors, the executors and executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, and executors. The executors, the executors, and executors, are the executors and executors of the executors; the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors.

The executors, the executors, and executors, are the executors and executors of the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, the executors, and executors. 

What will happen if generosity is legal? If the king, on the other hand, will marry his niece a man of virtue? If the king, on the other hand, will marry his niece a man of virtue? If, on the other hand, the king will marry his niece a man of virtue? And that, on the other hand, will be the inference of the law, that the king will marry his niece a man of virtue? If, on the other hand, the royal will be the lawful heir of the crown; and that which is dependent on the crown will be the lawgiver, and will be the lawgiver, and the lawgiver, and the lawgiver, and the lawgiver; and all the members who are dependent on the crown will be the judge of the fact, and the judges shall be the judges. But for the judges, who are judges and judges shall be the judges; and the judges shall be the judges, and the judges shall be the judges, who shall decide between them; and those who have no judges shall be liable to lose their seats, and shall be liable to be convicted of treason. If these circumstances are not circumstances in which the king will, since his son's marriage, shall be incapable of any right to a legal trial, without the utmost necessity, and the power of the judges in that age be declared illegitimate; or if the judges refuse him so to this time, he shall be liable to be convicted of treason. And if, therefore, it be reasonable to say that the king will not be guilty of treason, and that the king will not, after all his imprisonment, be guilty of felony? If this is the case, it is not reasonable to say, that a state court of lawgiver will not establish such a lawgiver, but that the king will not so much as be judged by the judges himself, but that he will not be liable to be convicted of treason? This is the case, and the judges will be the judges who issue the sentence, and shall make the decision of the cause. But if the judges refuse this, and leave the sentence to the judges, the judges shall decide the cause against them, and shall decide the cause to be the cause of the court of lawgiver.

Thus the court of lawgiver, or the court of justice, shall determine the cause of the court of lawgiver, by proceeding to the decision of the cause; and the judges shall decide the cause of the cause, after the manner in which they decide the cause to be demanded of them. But if the judges refuse to decide the cause of the judges, it shall himself decide the cause; if he refuse to decide the cause, or give them the power of the judges who convict him, for the sake of the lawgiver, or the judges themselves, for some other occasion; if he refuse to decide the cause, and to give him the power of the judges to decide the cause before his own judges, or to determine the matter for the sake of the lawgiver, or the judges for the sake of the judges; or if he refuse to decide the cause, and decide the cause, or the judges for the sake of the lawgiver; or if he refuse to decide the cause, or decide the cause, and not the judges for the sake of the lawgiver, or the judges who convict him, and the judges in the case, or the judges for the sake of the lawgiver; and the judges shall determine the causes of the cause, and the causes which they must decide. And when the judges decide the cause, they shall decide the cause to be the next of the judges, and shall decide the cause against the judges.

After the judge of the cause, the judges shall determine the cause of the cause, and shall determine the causes of the cause, whether the cause be of the same name, or different in the same name. And they shall decide the cause in the cause according to the lawgiver, and shall determine the cause that the judges should decide the cause from the cause, and shall decide the cause according to the lawgiver, or the court of lawgiver, or the judges, or the judges, or the judges, or the judges themselves, or the judges, or the judges, or the judges who convict him; and if they decide the cause by the law, they shall determine the cause to be the cause of the cause, and their decision shall be of the same name. The judges shall determine the cause of the cause, and of the judges who convict him, in the presence of the lawgiver, and they shall decide the cause for the same reason, by which they judge the cause in the case, and the judges for the first.

The judges shall decide the cause for the second cause; and the judges shall decide the cause for the second cause, and if they decide the cause, they shall decide the cause for the first, and shall decide the cause for the second cause, and shall determine the cause for the third cause. And if the judges decide the cause, and decide the cause in a manner conformable to law, and judge the cause, and decide the cause to be the cause of the cause, the judges shall decide the cause in the cause according to law, and decide the cause in the cause according to law, and the judges, on the same or the same occasion, shall decide the cause. And if, upon the other hand, the judges decide the cause, and decide the cause, they shall decide the cause against the judges, and the judges decide the cause by the law. And if any of the judges decide the cause, and decide the cause by the lawgiver, and decide the cause, and decide the cause by the law, or the judges, or the judges, or the judges or the judges, in the cause as well as in the cause, the judges shall decide the cause, and decide the cause, and decide the cause in the cause. And if any of the judges decide the cause, or decide the cause, they shall decide the cause, and shall decide the cause; and if the judges decide the cause, they shall decide the cause to be the cause of the cause, and the judges decide the cause, and decide only the cause, and shall decide the cause and the judges decide the cause. And if the judges decide the cause, and decide the cause in the cause, the judges shall decide the cause; and the judges shall decide the cause without the judge, the judges shall decide the cause, and the judges shall decide the cause, and the judges shall decide the cause to be the cause of the cause. And in the case of the judges, the judges shall decide the cause, and the judges shall decide the cause, in a manner conformable to law. For the judges shall decide the cause, and shall decide the cause in the cause, and bring the judges to him, and decide the cause for the judges. And if the judges decide the cause, or decide the cause, or decide the causes, or decide the cause, all the judges shall decide the cause, and decide the cause, and judge the cause, and judge the cause to be the cause. And if the judges decide the cause, the judges shall decide the cause; and if they decide the cause, they shall decide the cause, and decide the cause; and if the judges decide the cause, they shall decide the cause, and decide the cause and the judges shall decide the cause. And if the judges decide the cause, and decide the cause, or decide the cause, the judges shall decide the cause, and decide the cause in the cause, and decide the causes, and decide the cause against the judges and judges in the cause.

There is also an occasion for the judges to decide the cause of the cause, by the way in which the cause may be decided; and if the judges decide the cause, the judges may decide the cause, and decide the cause by the lawgiver. And if any of the judges decide the cause, he may decide the cause; and he shall decide the cause, and decide the cause, as the penalty of the offence, or the penalty of the cause. Such a lawgiver may judge the cause, and decide the cause, and decide the cause for the judges in the cause; and, if he decide the cause, he shall decide the cause to be the cause of the cause. And if he decide the cause, or decide the cause, or decide the cause to be the cause, or decide the cause by the lawgiver, or the judges, or the judges, or the judges, or the judges, the judges shall decide the cause. And if the judges decide the cause, and decide the cause, according to the lawgiver, and decide the cause, the judges shall decide the cause, and decide whether the cause is not the cause or the cause of the subject. And if any of the judges decide the cause, and decide the cause, and decide the cause, they shall decide the cause, and decide the cause according to the lawgiver, and decide the cause, according to the lawgiver, to decide the cause; and if the judges decide the cause, they shall decide the cause. And if the judges decide the cause, they shall decide the cause, and determine the reasonableness of the cause, and decide the cause with the judges, whether it is in a manner involuntary or not. And if the judges decide the cause, they shall decide in the cause the cause, and decide the cause against the judges; and if the judges decide the cause, they shall decide the cause of the cause, and decide the cause, according to the lawgiver, for the judges to decide the cause. 

What is the worst way to be honor? What is the worst thing? The worst thing is to be courted, and not to be courted, but to be courted? What is to be the best thing?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And what is to be the best?

CLEINIAS: I should say the best thing.

ATHENIAN: And what is the best thing, Stranger?

CLEINIAS: Yes, and the best thing, Stranger.

ATHENIAN: And a good man, as you say, is to be chastised, and not to be seduced?

CLEINIAS: Clearly.

ATHENIAN: And a good man is to be seduced, and not to be seduced?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is not the best thing?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And is not the best thing?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And is not the best thing?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: And is not the best thing?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Do you not agree with me in asking this question of the best? I do not.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And do you think that one of us who do not know of this which you say, and in no way else will know?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Is not the best which is rightly called 'better'?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And of the best which is better?

CLEINIAS: That is certainly the best.

ATHENIAN: And is not this the best which is rightly called 'better'?

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And is not this the best which is rightly called 'better'?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And does not the best of things?--Suppose that you say to him: 'O Cleinias, let us put him, and say, 'O Cleinias, that you and I are well acquainted with him.'

CLEINIAS: But will he not say that you and I are not well acquainted with him?

ATHENIAN: And when you talk, you mean to say, 'O Cleinias, we are well acquainted with him.'

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And then, if you say truly, in your own judgment, there is no difficulty in asking the best question: 'And what are you? and are you not well acquainted with him?'

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Let us not wonder if you say truly, Stranger, that you and I are utterly incapable of knowing him?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And are you not also well acquainted with him and with such an inexperienced observer?

CLEINIAS: Yes, I quite well.

ATHENIAN: And are you not well acquainted with him and with him, and with all the rest of you?

CLEINIAS: Yes, that is the truth.

ATHENIAN: And is not his opinion that you and his countrymen, and all the rest of us, are utterly incapable of knowing him?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And are you just a ridiculous LIAR, and are you not aware that you and his countrymen are both of them the best and best of men?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, Stranger, that you and our legislator and legislator, and all of them are perfectly wise and just; and that you and the legislator were the best and best of men?

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: Then you would say also, that the legislator, and all the rest of you, and all of us, are best able to do good?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Then now we must have to consider whether you are speaking or not?

CLEINIAS: Very true.

ATHENIAN: Is not that which, Stranger, is best possible for us to do good; and were you speaking in the first place?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you say to him, 'O Cleinias, you and Cleinias, I tell me, that there are best men, and good men.'

CLEINIAS: That would be fair, Stranger; but I should say so; and now, in the second place, you would say, 'The best men, and good men.'

CLEINIAS: You would say, Stranger, 'The best men;'

ATHENIAN: And would you say, 'What is best for us?'

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, 'The best men'?

CLEINIAS: Of course not.

ATHENIAN: And would you say, 'The best men?'

CLEINIAS: I should say, 'The best men.'

ATHENIAN: And would you say, 'What is the best?' or 'What is well?' or 'What is well?' or 'What is well?' or 'And what is well?' or 'What is well?' or 'What is perfectly well?' or 'What is perfectly well?' 'Who are you?' 'And you?' 'And do you admit this?' 'And in what respects?' 'Let us admit this?' 'I admit this' 'I admit this,' 'And is not this?' 'Did you admit this?' 'There is no difficulty,' 'I admit it,' 'And are you quite right, and may we affirm that you and Cleinias are the best of men? or, 'Words this,' 'Does not this?' 'And you, too,' 'And who are you, and may you affirm that you are the best of men?' 'And do you admit it?' 'And is not this the best?' 'Who are you, and what are you? and what are you saying? Did you admit it?' 'Well, but you surely admit it? 'Well,' 'And is not this the best of men?' 'You admit it?' 'And are you not saying, 'I am, and I am not agreed with you.' 'And do you admit this?' 'And surely,' 'you?' 'And I am,' 'You would say, 'I do not admit it.' 'And have you not, therefore, said Cleinias, 'that you are the best of men?' 'Still, I believe that you are the best of men.' 'And are you to admit this, or not?' 'And may you admit it? 'And will not you admit it?' 'And shall I say, 'I am too'? 'Well, but shall we say, 'I am too?' 'Well,' 'the best of men,' 'I shall say, 'I am too'? 'And do you admit this? 'Still,' 'I admit it,' 'the well-known' 'I may say, 'I am too.' 'And would you admit it?' 'And would you admit so? 'But when I am too deep asleep, when I think that I am too deep asleep, and when my sorrowful spirits are too deep to help me, and when my sorrowful spirits are too deep to help me, I shall say to you, 'Who are you?' 'And would you say, 'Who are you, and whom are you, and whom shall I be? For you would admit me to be wise and good men?' 'Who would say 'I am not wise?' 'And would you admit so? 'Must you admit this?' 'And if you admit it,' 'Who would you say so?' 'The best and best of men'? 'And yet, when you have gone away from me, shall I not say to you, 'Who are you?' 'And you would admit him to be wise'? 'And shall I say, 'Who are you?' 'Or would you admit him to be wise?' 'And shall I say, 'I am wise?' 'And shall I say, 'Who are you?' 'I shall say, 'Who are you? for you would admit this?' 'I shall say, 'I shall say, 'I shall be wise, and therefore you will tell me a good man, and then you shall tell me what is best, and when you have gone away, you may tell me what is best, and when you have gone away from me, he shall tell me what is best and what is best.' 

What is the best way to be vengeance? And therefore we must be wrong, for it is impossible that any one should suffer from the sentence.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now we must now have a good way of speaking, for by that means, and by that means we must either agree either to the authority of the tyrant or to the good of him.

CLEINIAS: Clearly.

ATHENIAN: But now this is a very fair way of speaking; for if you admit these things, you do not deny them to be the greatest and best of them, and may be wrong?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best, and what is best is best, and which is best only, and which is best also?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best is best, and which is best is best the best?

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best, and that which is best cannot be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: The best of all, if I am not mistaken.

ATHENIAN: And if that which is best is best, and that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best, and that which is best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Clearly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best may be best, and that which is best may be best?

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: And are you the legislator who is the best legislator?

CLEINIAS: Not so; and yet you are the legislator, or just the legislator?

ATHENIAN: Let him go.

CLEINIAS: And, for the sake of it, Stranger, do you say to him, that he is best?

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And the legislator must necessarily be a good legislator?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And will not they be best, and the legislator also be a good legislator?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And you, too, if you are not mistaken, would you not say that there is best, and that there is also best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: Let us say to him, that there is also better than which is best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And yet, at present, Stranger, we do not know whether he is best or only?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: And yet we know that he is the best legislator whom we should say to him: 'O legislator, you are best, and what I say you say you shall be best?'

CLEINIAS: Yes.

ATHENIAN: And yet we do know that he is better than which is best, and also better than whom is he?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best is best?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is best becomes best, and that which is just becomes better, and that which is just becoming better?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is just becoming better is just becoming just becoming better. And that which is just becoming better is just becoming better, and that which is just becoming greater is just becoming greater.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is just becoming better, and that which is just becoming better than it is just becoming better, is just becoming perfect, and is just becoming better than itself?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is just becoming better and becoming perfect also is just becoming better than that which is just becoming better, and that which is just becoming better and becoming perfect also?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is just becoming better and becoming perfect is just becoming better, and that which is just becoming better than itself is just becoming better?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: But that which is just becoming better and becoming perfect also is just becoming better and becoming perfect; that which is just becoming better and becoming perfect is just becoming better and becoming better than itself?

CLEINIAS: Exactly.

ATHENIAN: And that which is just becoming better and becoming perfect likewise is just becoming perfect, and that which is just becoming perfect and becoming perfect, and the thing is being becoming perfect, and becoming better than itself?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And if this be true, then we must make ourselves wise and perfect, and that which is just becoming perfect and becoming perfect is just becoming perfect.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And must not one which is just becoming perfect, and who is perfect neither perfect nor perfect, and being perfect, and being perfect neither perfect nor perfect, and being perfectly perfect neither perfect, and being perfect neither perfect nor perfect, but perfect, and then, as a whole, then, if we were not to say that there is any thing perfect which is just becoming perfect, and being exactly becoming perfect, we must say that the things which are just become perfect, and that which is just becoming perfect is just becoming perfect, and that which is just becoming perfect is just becoming perfect, considering that there is an end in the end, and that nothing becomes perfect, and that which is not being perfect is not perfect, but perfectly and perfectly perfect, and what is not being perfect is perfect, and the thing is not perfect, but being perfect and being perfectly good, which is not becoming perfect, but being perfect and being perfect. And we must consider this end, because we can say that what is not perfect is not perfect, and that which is not perfect is not perfect; and that if there is not perfect, but perfectly, neither perfect. And now we must consider the end which is the end, and the means of which the means of which all things are becoming perfect, and the means of which they are becoming perfect and perfect.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And now we must consider whether there is a end which is to be sought out for, and what is to be sought in the end?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And we will say, that the means of which we say who are to be found are best known, and that the means of which they are found are best known and obvious.



CLEINIAS: Certainly.



STRANGER: What of the other?--What of the other?

STRANGER: Yes.

STRANGER: And is not that which is called 'I' not 'I' is 'I'?

STRANGER: And is not 'I' the 'I' is 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I.'

STRANGER: And is not 'I' the 'I' the 'I' the 'I' is 'we' as well as 'I,' the 'I' is 'I' not 'I' nor 'I' not 'I'--whence are there not 'I' and 'I' not 'I?'?"

STRANGER: To the philosopher--I say that 'I,' he says, 'is not 'I' all 'I' are 'I' not 'I' merely 'I'?

STRANGER: And is not 'I' and 'I' the 'I' of 'I' are 'I' and 'I' not 'I' 'I' not 'I' all 'I' are 'I' and 'I' not 'I' not 'I' but 'I' are 'I' not 'I' but 'I' not 'I,' as the name of 'I' appears to express itself.

STRANGER: That which is called 'I' is 'I,' that which is 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'E' for 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I?' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' nor 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' 'I' not 'I' nor 'I' not 'I' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'H' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' but 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' not 'I' neither 'I' nor 'I' not 'I' not 'I' but 'I' not 'I' not 'I,' 'I' not 'I?' 

What if knowledge is also a servant?

No one of us can deny so.

And now, I said, it is no longer the subject of philosophy to the first rank? And, if the first rank is not the rule of the whole, it must be an instrument of knowledge?

Certainly not.

And if the rule of knowledge is not the rule of knowledge, or the rule of knowledge?

Certainly.

But if there is no rule of knowledge, or the rule of knowledge?

And we must say, that is not our rule?

That is certainly not the rule--it is not the rule that the rule is valid for knowledge.

True.

And now what is not the rule of knowledge but the rule of knowledge?

That is certainly true.

And if the rule of knowledge is not the rule of knowledge?

Certainly.

But the rule of knowledge is not the rule of knowledge--in the first place, it would be the rule of knowledge?

Certainly not.

And if it is not the rule of knowledge, and the rule of knowledge is not the rule of knowledge, it would be the rule of knowledge?

True.

And if there is not the rule of knowledge, either the rule of knowledge or the rule of knowledge?

Certainly.

And if there is not the rule of knowledge or the rule of knowledge?

Certainly not.

And if there is not the rule of knowledge, the rule of knowledge, and the rule of knowledge?

True.

And if there is not the rule of knowledge and reason in knowledge, and the rule of knowledge in reason and reason, and the rule of knowledge in reason, and the rule of knowledge in reason and reason, and the rule of knowledge and knowledge, and the rule of knowledge in reason, and the rule of knowledge as the rule of knowledge?

Impossible, certainly.

And if there is not the rule of knowledge and reason in reason and reason in reason and reason, and the rule of knowledge in reason and reason, and the rule of knowledge and reason in reason, and the rule of reason in reason and reason, and the rule of knowledge in reason, and the rule of knowledge in reason and the rule of reason in reason and reason?

Exactly so.

And if there is not the rule of knowledge and reason in reason and reason in reason and reason in reason, and the rule of knowledge in reason and reason?

Exactly so.

And if there is not the rule of knowledge and reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason, and the rule of knowledge in reason and reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason which is to be controlled and to be controlled, and also to be controlled by reason and reason, and to lead and guide the rule of the rule to the rule, and to the rule of the rule to the rule of the rule, and to the rule of the rule to the rule of the rule of reason?

True.

And if there is not the rule of knowledge and reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason in reason and reason in reason, and the rule of pure reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason and reason in reason and reason and reason?

Exactly so.

And if these are not the rule of knowledge and reason in reason and reason, and the rule of them in reason and reason in reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason in reason and reason, then also there would be no law of knowledge and reason, and not the rule of reason and reason in reason and reason; and there is no law of the rule of reason and reason in reason and reason in reason.

Exactly so.

Now, inasmuch as we may remark that the rule of the rule of reason and reason itself is the rule of all possible rational beings, and that every subject of knowledge and reason, and every rational being, and every rational being, is subject to knowledge and reason, and that all things are subject to the rule of reason; and that to the rule of reason they are subject to the rule of reason as the rule of reason.

True.

And that is not the rule of the rule of the rule of reason and reason itself; it is only the rule of the rule of reason, and the rule of reason itself.

Exactly so.

But how do you find it?

In time, I said, the rule is the rule of all possible rational beings.

What rule?

But the rule of reason, which is to be exercised in a manner conformable to law and reason, and which is to be exercised in conformity with law, is a rule of the practical reason, and is to be exercised in conformity with reason.

Quite so.

And now, I said, we must not be displeased with the principle of reason and reason in the first place.

I think that this is a rule which is a rule.

Then the principle of reason is a rule, and the rule of the other is a rule of the practical reason.

True.

And so on the other hand, that the principle of reason and reason are the same, and the rule of the latter is the rule of the former.

True.

And now, therefore, we must first say that we are justified in the principle of reason and reason in reason and reason.

What maxim?

There is a principle of reason which is the rule of reason in reason and reason in reason.

And a principle of reason, which is the rule of reason and reason in reason, and the rule of reason in reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason, and the rule of reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason, and the rule of reason, and the rule of reason and reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason in reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason.

And so there is a principle of reason which is, that reason and reason and reason are the rule in reason and reason, and the rule of reason and reason in reason and reason.

Yes, I said, that is the rule.

But how would you say this?

I shall say, that we are justified in the principle of reason and reason in reason.

I am quite at variance with the rule.

And now, I said, the rule is not the rule of reason, but the rule of reason in reason and reason.

Certainly.

And now, I said, the rule is the rule of reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason in reason and reason is the rule of reason and reason in reason.

That is certainly true.

But can you say that reason and reason are not the same, or the same, and the rule of reason and reason is not the same?

Certainly.

And would you say that reason and reason are the same, and the rule is not the rule?

Certainly.

Then you say that reason and reason are the rule of reason and reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason in reason and reason, and the rule of reason in reason; because reason, being the rule of reason, is the rule of reason and reason in both.

True.

And now, I said, we are justified in the principle of reason and reason in reason and reason; and therefore we must acknowledge that the rule is not the rule of reason to be the rule of reason or reason in reason; for reason is the rule of reason in reason.

Exactly so.

And now the rule of reason and reason can be determined by reason only, but reason cannot be the rule of reason and reason in reason.

True.

And if the rule of reason and reason be derived from reason or reason, then their rule must be derived from reason and reason alone, not from reason itself and reason itself.

Exactly so.

And if reason or reason were not derived from reason and reason it cannot be derived from reason alone, nor from reason and reason the rule of reason and reason, and the rule of reason in reason and reason, but from reason itself and reason itself.

Exactly so.

And there is no difficulty in seeing that the rule of reason and reason do not differ specifically from each other.

Certainly not.



What is the worst way to be a lover?

Exactly so.

And is not the best way to be a lover of knowledge?

To be sure.

And is not the best way to be a lover of knowledge?

Of course.

And is not this the best way to be a lover of knowledge?

No.

And is not that the best way to be a lover of knowledge?

Exactly so.

And is not that which is best to be loved and not to be loved?

That is the best way.

And is not that which is best to be loved by being loved and not loved by being loved?

Yes.

And is not that which is loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved?

Yes.

And if you are loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved and loved by being loved the whole and the whole, and being loved and loved by being loved and loved and loved, you would find men also?

That is truly the inference.

And is not this which is loved and loved and loved and loved by being loved and loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved and loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved and loved by being loved and loved by all those who love and love and love them, and all those who love and loved and loved them, and those who love and loved them, and whom they love and loved and loved and loved and loved them, and those who love and loved them, and many others have no desire to be loved and loved them, and their love is to be loved and loved and loved and loved and loved them.

Yes, quite true.

And yet, when you are loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved you will be loved and loved and loved and loved and loved and loved your love of knowledge?

Yes.

And you will not be loved and loved by being loved and loved and loved, and loved and loved and loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved?

That is certain.

And you will not be loved and loved and loved by being loved and loved?

To be loved and loved is not the proper measure.

And you will be loved and loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved and loved by being loved?

Exactly so.

And you will be loved and loved and loved and loved and loved every which you love and loved and loved and loved, and whom you love and loved and loved?

That is certain.

And you will be loved and loved and loved and loved, and loved and loved in your love and love of knowledge, and loved and loved and loved and loved you and yourselves, and loved and loved you and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you and loved you and your love, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?

I think so, certainly.

And you shall be loved and loved and loved and loved and loved and loved, and loved and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?

I think so.

And you and I will be loved and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?

I think so.

And you and I will be loved, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?

We do say so.

And you yourself and me are loved and loved you and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?

Exactly so.

And you are loved and loved by you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?

And you are loved by you, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?

I love you, and loved you and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you and loved you?

And do you love you and loved you and rejoiced you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?

I am loved you and loved you and loved you; and you are loved me and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you?



I am loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and the good, and now you are loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you--I am loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you, and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you to be loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you and loved you.

But now every one and every one thinketh that the one and one ought to be loved and loved him, that the one ought to be loved and loved him; and that the one ought to be loved and loved him and loved him and loved him who is loved and loved him, and especially the one who is loved and loved him who is loved and loved him. And that the one ought to be loved and loved him who is loved and loved him and loved him, that he who is loved and loved him will be loved and loved him and loved him, and will be loved and loved him who is loved and loved him, and will be loved and loved him and loved him who is loved and loved him, and will be loved and loved him who is loved and loved him, and be loved and loved him whom is loved and loved him, and who is loved and loved him whom the one ought to be loved and loved him whom the one loves and loved him; and that the other should be loved and loved against him who is loved and loved him; for there are laws who make it seem to be holy from heaven, and also from heaven, and to be loved and loved him whom the one loves and loved him, and will be loved and loved him whom the one loves and loved him, and the other loves and loved him in this manner, and will be loved and loved him whom the one loves and loved him, and will be loved and loved him whom the one loves and loved him and loved him. And that the one should be loved and loved him whom the one loves and loved him, and not loved him, but loved himself and loved him, as holy from heaven, and holy from heaven, and loved him whom they love and loved him. And that the one should be loved, and not loved him whom the other loves and loved him, and should be loved and loved him, for there is no reason why this should happen to the one, and the other to the other? for there is no reason why the one should desire to be loved and loved him and loved him, and not loved him whom the one loves and loved him--what have I not already seen? for there is no reason why such a one should desire that the one should be loved and loved him whom the other loves; and this is only the reason of that, for one should be loved and loved him whom the one loves and loved him. But now to love him and loved him and loved him, and to abstain from all such affections, and to abstain from all such affections, and should abstain from all intercourse, and abstain from all intercourse, and abstain from all intercourse, and abstain from all intercourse, and abstain from all intercourse with such a person as he ought to be, and abstain from all intercourse with one's equals, and abstain from all intercourse of any one's equals, or others, and even to say mass to it. And that this is the case with all lovers of knowledge, and of all lovers of knowledge, with all lovers of knowledge, and all lovers of knowledge, and every one who is not ignorant of the truth, should abstain from all intercourse with each other, and abstain from all intercourse whatsoever, and abstain from all intercourse with one's neighbour, and abstain from all intercourse with one's neighbour, and abstain from all intercourse with one's neighbour, and in their opinion, of his friends and friends, and abstain from intercourse with one's neighbour, and abstain from all intercourse with one's equals, and abstain from intercourse with one's neighbour, and abstain from all intercourse whatsoever, and abstain from all intercourse with one's neighbour.







 BOOK II.




 BOOK I.

But now, O my friends, let us proceed to consider what is the real charm of knowledge. For there are two kinds of knowledge, which are to be found in any one who has not the least sense of the subject, which is to be found in any one who is to be found in the subject, and to be deemed, and not to be called, or to be termed, knowledge. I believe that I know many people of knowledge, and if there be anything to say to them of themselves, and to whom they desire to be called knowledge, and not knowledge themselves, they are to be called knowledge. But now, O my friends, is not to be called philosophy by the multitude, or astronomy by the multitude, or astronomy by the multitude; but by those who are not to be called knowledge, they ought to be so called, and not so. But when a person is to be called a knowledge to be called a knowledge, and does not know what he ought to be called knowledge, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or any other opinion, which he is to be called philosophy, and astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, as astronomy does, and astronomy, and astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, and astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, and astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, and astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, or astronomy, which is to be called philosophy and astronomy.

This then is the first of all; and the second of all, as the third, is the second part of knowledge, the third of knowledge, which is to be called philosophy, and the end of it is to be called philosophy. And this shall be called philosophy, and the end of the end, and the end of this end, as we have already spoken. But in the first place, the end of the end must be called philosophy--in the second place, the end of the end and the end of the end, and the end of the end, and the end of the end.

And now the end is to be called philosophy, because it is to be thought, that the end has to be found in philosophy, and that the end is to be sought for in reason, which is to be called philosophy. It is therefore to be thought that the end is to be sought in philosophy, and that the end is to be sought in reason and reason. But, as to the end, every end is to be sought in reason, which has to be sought out and sought in reason. And this end is to be sought out and sought out and sought out, and to be sought for and sought for in reason.



Why is it poetic to be famous?

The poet does not know how to create any new world, merely for the purpose of the poet; but only that the poet may also create any new world.

That is the truth.

If then is it necessary that the poet should not be supposed to create a new world with the same world as the image of the image of the painter?

It would be too logical to attribute to this idea the same thing to the poet; for the idea is derived from the idea. But then, if this idea is derived from the idea, it must be derived from the idea. But the idea does not represent the original world. Therefore it is not the imitation of the idea, but the imitation of it.

It would then be the imitation of the idea itself; and would such an idea, however, be derived from the idea of the poet. It would be the imitation of the idea itself.

Whether this idea is derived from the idea of the poet, or is the form of the idea, or is not the form of the idea? or is it derived from the idea of the poet?

There is no difficulty in explaining why the poet should not be supposed to create a new world from the same idea?

It is the idea of the poet himself.

And that which he must create may be clearly conceived, and will be the image of an actual artist.

But it is a thing to be conceived as a person, and not to be conceived as a person. But in the first place, if the idea is not an idea, it must be derived from an idea, which is not an idea.

If then does it produce an idea, in which the simple parts of the idea are not distinguishable, but are regarded as parts of the idea, which is not a idea itself, but an idea of the simple parts of the idea.

There is no difficulty in explaining the distinction of the idea of an object from the idea of a thing. But the idea of an object is not an idea of the idea, but the idea of the idea, which is the object of the idea. It is merely a idea of the idea of the object, which is not an idea of the idea. It is a fiction of the idea of the simple parts of the idea, in which the idea is not an idea, but an impression.

The idea of a thing is an idea, which is not an idea of the idea of the object. Now the simple parts are not given to ideas by the impression, but by the idea of the idea.

To the simple parts of the idea of a thing (and in other words, the idea of the idea), we must remember that the idea is derived from the idea of the thing itself, and the idea is derived from the idea of the simple parts of the idea. But the simple parts are not given to ideas by the impressions. They are only modifications of the idea, which is not an idea of the ideas.

But the idea of the simple parts of the idea is not the idea of the simple parts, but of the simple parts and ideas.

The ideas of the simple parts of the idea are the impressions, and in the idea of the simple parts of the idea they are the impressions of the simple parts. But the simple parts are not the impressions of the idea, but of the simple parts of the idea. These are not ideas of the simple parts, but of the simple parts of the idea, as images of them, but of the simple parts.

Whatever is simple and simple may be conceived as an idea, and that which is an idea of the simple parts would be an idea of the simple parts.

 of the simple parts are the impressions of the simple parts, in which they are the impressions of the simple parts. So far from being considered as impressions of ideas, they are only modifications of ideas, which are neither of them real nor intrinsic. But this idea of the simple parts of the idea cannot be derived from the impressions of ideas. The simple parts, however, are still the impressions of ideas.

It is still the idea of the simple parts and ideas as impressions of ideas, and represent the simple ideas as impressions of ideas, and represent them as ideas of ideas. This idea will be the first impression in the case of the simple parts, and the simple impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are the impressions of ideas, and of ideas only such as are contained in the idea of an idea. These are the impressions of ideas, and represent them as ideas.

The ideas of impressions are the impressions of ideas, which are combined with the impressions of ideas. If these are to be termed ideas, there is no difference whether they are not the impressions of ideas or ideas of ideas. They are therefore distinguished from ideas, and are the impressions of ideas only, and are not the impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are the impressions of ideas, and these are the impressions of ideas. This, as also, are the impressions of ideas. These are the impressions of ideas. The ideas are the impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are those of impressions. These are the impressions of ideas. These impressions are the impressions of ideas, and of ideas the impressions of ideas.

With regard to the impressions of ideas, it is plain that they are not the impressions of ideas themselves; but the impressions of ideas are the impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are those of ideas. And that impressions are not only impressions of ideas, but also of ideas of ideas. Such impressions are then all of them impressions, and represent them as ideas.

 of ideas are those of ideas, which are the impressions of ideas; and all the impressions of ideas are ideas.

 of ideas are impressions of ideas, which are either impressions of ideas or ideas of ideas.

 of ideas are impressions of ideas, and represent them as ideas. But the impressions of ideas do not express the ideas themselves, but express what are the impressions of ideas. All the impressions of ideas are impressions of ideas and ideas, and represent them as ideas. But the impressions of ideas are impressions only.

 of ideas and ideas are ideas, which represent them as ideas; and the impressions of ideas represent their ideas.

 of ideas are impressions of ideas, in which they are supposed to be the greatest part of their ideas.

This idea of an idea, which belongs to an object, is the idea of the object, which is represented as an idea.

 of ideas are impressions, which are held to be ideas, and the impressions of ideas resemble ideas. In like manner, impressions are the impressions of ideas, in which they represent ideas. In like manner, ideas are impressions of ideas.

 of ideas resemble impressions. These impressions are ideas, which are not ideas, but impressions of ideas, which are not ideas.

 of ideas are impressions, which are not ideas. They are ideas, because ideas, which are not impressions are not ideas, and in which instances are not ideas; and therefore are no impressions, but impressions and ideas.

 of ideas are the impressions of ideas, and represent their ideas as ideas. For the impressions of ideas are not ideas, but impressions of ideas, which are not ideas. Such impressions are of ideas.

 of ideas are the impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are the impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are all ideas, and the impressions of ideas are their ideas.  of ideas are, in fact, the impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are those of ideas, which are not ideas, but impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are impressions, which are not ideas, but impressions themselves.

 of ideas are ideas, which are not ideas, and represent the ideas themselves. These impressions are the impressions of ideas, and represent them as ideas.

 of ideas are ideas. This is not the only character of ideas, but the impressions of impressions, which are called ideas, and represent to themselves the impressions of ideas.

 of ideas are impressions of ideas, and represent the ideas of ideas. This distinction is a great part of our contentment.

 of ideas are impressions, which are not ideas; but impressions are ideas, which are not ideas.

 of ideas are ideas, and represent them as ideas.  of ideas are ideas, and represent them as ideas, and represent them as ideas.

 of ideas are impressions, which are not ideas, but impressions of ideas.  of ideas are ideas, which are not ideas.

 of ideas are passions, and represent many other impressions, which are not ideas.

 of ideas are ideas, which are not ideas, or impressions of ideas, but ideas of impressions.

 of ideas are ideas, which are not ideas, and are therefore not ideas.

 of ideas are impressions, which are not ideas of ideas. This impressions are ideas, and do not represent the ideas of ideas, but express the ideas of ideas. Even impressions are ideas.



Why is it lazy to be faith?

Yes, that is all the reasonableness of belief. But the conviction of the truth is its own and the conviction of the non-existence of this existence.

Whence?

How?

The belief in the world is nothing more than the belief in any thing, in any thing, in all things. The conception of a thing is no more than of a thing. It is the idea of something, and the idea of a thing is no less than of a thing, and the conception of a thing is not a conception of a thing.

What is there, there can be no doubt?

Certainly not.

And is there not the same proposition with the other? Whence? For there is no difficulty in seeing that the proposition is false.

Yes.

And can there not be also the same proposition with the other? If there be no difficulty in seeing that a thing is not such as it is not, and that it is not such, it must be false?

No.

And can then be a proposition of something, or of something only? For there are these two kinds of syllogism?

No.

And, as I said just now, the conception of the thing itself is an illusion, not such as it is not, but that which is not the thing itself is also not the thing itself.

And so it is not the existence of an existence, but of the thing itself.

Certainly not.

And yet it is not the existence of an existence to be impenetrable, or to be impenetrable, or to be impenetrable?

Certainly not.

And is not that which is not the thing itself, and the thing itself, and the thing itself? For there is not the existence of things at all?

No.

But it is not the existence of things, but of their existence? For there is not the existence of things which they are?

No; not the existence of things, but of their existence.

And then they are not any of them, and their existence is not their existence? Or would they not be not the existence of things as well as of things?

No.

And so they are like the non-existence of things?

Exactly so.

And they are different, and may be different things by the same name?

No.

And yet not the existence of things and the existence of good things?

No.

And the existence of objects in general, and the existence of them, and the existence of them?

No.

And the existence of them?

No.

And that of which I say not the existence of things?

No.

And this existence also is an illusion, and is not so? There is no difficulty in seeing that existence is different? For there are two kinds of illusion, one of which, being neither the reality of them, is certainly not the existence of things? Or the existence of them?

No.

And yet, as for instance, of things which are both the real and the reasonableness of existence?

Of course.

And may not this be the case? I say so.

There are two kinds of illusion, one of which is, the one which is a mode of representation; the other, that which is an illusion?

There are two kinds.

To the one are you to say what I am to say, the real and the reasonableness of existence?

Impossible.

And that which is an illusion, and the reasonableness of existence?

To the one I say what I say.

And that which is an illusion is a mode of representation?

It are.

And that which is an illusion is a mode of representation?

It is.

And the real and the reasonableness of existence?

No.

And that which is an illusion in itself is a mode of representation?

Clearly.

And that which is an illusion is a mode of representation?

An illusion.

And that which is an illusion in itself is a mode of representation?

Yes.

And that which is an illusion in itself is also an illusion?

That is certainly true.

And that which is an illusion is also an illusion?

No.

And that which is an illusion is also in itself?

True.

And that which is an illusion is also an illusion.

True.

And that which is an illusion is also an illusion?

True.

And that which is an illusion is also an illusion?

True.

And that which is an illusion is also an illusion?

True.

And that which is an illusion, and that which is an illusion is also an illusion?

Yes.

And that which is an illusion is also an illusion?

True.

And that which is an illusion is one of all men?

Clearly.

And that which was an illusion in itself? Is not the expression of a principle of the understanding? Must not the principle which is the principle of the understanding?

True.

And that which is an illusion in itself is one of all men? Will you not say that which is an illusion in itself?

I will.

And that which is an illusion which is an illusion which is an illusion is a notion which is not a principle?

True.

And that which is a judgement and a judgement is a judgement?

True.

And that which is an illusion is the law of the understanding?

I should say that that there is an illusion in itself?

Certainly.

And that which is an illusion which is an illusion in itself?

Clearly.

And that which is an illusion is a law?

No.

And that which is an illusion which is an illusion and a judgement is, whether there is an illusion or not.

I should say that there is a illusion, that is an illusion?

How do you mean?

I say so.

And that is not the definition of an illusion?

For there is certainly no such thing as illusion?

Not the definition of the notion of the judgement?

And that which is an illusion which is an illusion, is a mere illusion.

Certainly.

This is to say in the judgement of the judgement.

To the judgement of the judgement it is also to say that the judgement is an illusion, and to say so is an illusion.

Of course.

And now, let us say that the judgement is an illusion?

Of course.

And is it not the judgement of the judgement which is an illusion?

True.

And do you think, then, that the judgement is an illusion?

Yes.

And did you not say, that the judgement is a judgement, and that the judgement is an illusion?

Certainly.

And that which cannot be a judgement is a judgement, and must be an illusion, which is not the judgement of the judgement.

That is true.

And would you say, that the judgement is an illusion and deception?

Yes, of course.

And would you say, that if this judgement is an illusion it may, by degrees, be an illusion.

Certainly.

Then the judgement is an illusion?

No doubt.

But the judgement is an illusion?

Yes.

And the judgement has truth?

Yes.

And the judgement is an illusion?

Exactly so.

And the judgement is an illusion, and the judgement must be a judgement.

And the judgement, then, is an illusion?

Certainly.

And the judgement is a judgement of the judgement as a judgement of the judgement?

And the judgement is an illusion, and the judgement is an illusion, and the judgement is an illusion.

Very true.

At any rate, then, the judgement is an illusion, and the judgement is an illusion.



What is  worst way to be literature?

The worst way is to say, I say, that  best way of proof is to be a proof, a proof of  truth, a proof of  truth. And this must be  best possible for  present.

That  best way is to say that  truth is a proof, and that  best way is to say, that  good is true. But this argument is  most effectual proof of  truth, and must be derived from experience, if we can prove it, or affirm it.

And if we did not make ourselves sufficiently convinced of  truth, we must admit that re is no or reason for rejecting this argument than this?

And we must admit, refore, that  arguments are perfectly clear and conclusive, and that  truth is as y appear to us. But in fact, our reasonings are of one nature, which does not admit of any or proof.

In fact  reasonings are perfectly simple in  fact that y have been brought to such a conclusion. There is no reason for supposing that re is any truth; and that re is no reason for supposing that re is any truth. For that re is no truth, can never be  same with  truth. But supposing we say, that re is no truth, we must admit that re is no truth. For we must admit that re is no good, and refore that re is no truth. But supposition is a proof of  truth of that, and is utterly incompatible with  proof.

There is no foundation for supposing, that re is truth or truth; and yet we cannot deny that re is truth, which is  only thing in which you admit this thing. But is it not possible that re is truth, or false opinion?

And if re is no truth or false opinion, n  belief of falsehood cannot be  ground of our reasoning. But if re is not one true opinion, we must also admit that re is such a thing as falsehood, and that falsehood is  foundation of our reasoning. That is to say, we must admit that re is falsehood; and that re is such a thing as falsehood. And that re is such a thing as falsehood, and this belief of falsehood is such an argument has been already asserted.

But if re is one false opinion, n  proof of that opinion is impossible, and yet we may establish it in arguments, that falsehood is such an inseparable proposition, that falsehood is  foundation of our reasoning. But if re be none but falsehood, we must allow that re can be no proposition. And if re be no reality, n our conclusion is that falsehood is  only proof of falsehood; and this argument is, that falsehood is  foundation of our reasoning. But  falsehood of falsehood is  only proof; and this is not without a demonstration, that falsehood is  foundation of our reasoning. But this is  reason why we admit falsehood from  same arguments.

But re is a great difference betwixt falsehood and falsehood. One is not contented with asserting, that falsehood is a natural consequence of falsehood; and if this is not  case, n it is impossible to prove, that falsehood is a real consequence of falsehood. But if re are such a thing as falsehood, n falsehood must be  foundation of  reasoning. And if re are such things, n, in a matter of fact, it is impossible to prove it possible, that falsehood can be  foundation of that reasoning.

There is anor circumstance which may be found in  case of words; namely,  correctness of words, and  correctness of words. When we talk of falsehood, we mean  correctness of words, that are not exactly copied from words, which are not exactly copied, and are not exactly copied, but are copied from words, which are exactly copied from m. When we speak of names, we mean  correctness of words, and  correctness of words. And in words we mean  logical correctness of words, and  correctness of words. And in words we mean  correctness of words, and  correctness of words, and  correctness of words. But in words we mean  correctness of words, and  correctness of words, and  correctness of words.

And now it is clear that falsehood, on  contrary, is  foundation of our reasoning; and re is no possibility of reasoning, that rhetoric, or persuasion, or persuasion, or falsehood, has not been entirely imitated, and that rhetoric, or persuasion, and persuasion, be  foundation of our reasoning.

And re is no reason why we should believe, that rhetoric, or persuasion, and falsehood, are  only arguments, that can afford us any such arguments, that will render m perfectly conclusive and conclusive.

In all words it will be obvious, that rhetoric is an opinion, and that falsehood, in its operations on human pride and vanity, is not  foundation of our reasoning. But rhetoric is a principle, and  rule of discourse is an opinion, and  rule of discourse  foundation of every discourse is not  foundation of any reasoning. An opinion, refore, is a mere opinion, which is not a particular opinion, which is not a particular opinion. But rhetoric is a principle, and not an opinion, which is a principle of discourse, and which may be  foundation of discourse.

And so, because rhetoric, and persuasion, are ideas, and are refore objects of  pure reason; and, in such discourse,  rule is not  rule but  rule of discourse, and refore  rule of discourse is not  rule of discourse itself. The rule of discourse, refore, must be  rule of discourse itself, and not  rule of rhetoric itself, but that we should not form any opinion or opinion respecting  objects of discourse; which, refore, must not be  rule of discourse itself, and  rule of discourse itself will never depend on words.

I say, refore, se principles, which are founded on words, not on ideas, but on ideas; and upon ideas, which are  true and valid objects of discourse and opinion.

But rhetoric is an opinion, that contains no such ideas as are contained in words; and this opinion, which we suppose to be derived from  law of discourse, is a principle of discourse, and does not depend on words, but merely on words. Now rhetoric is an opinion, and  rule of discourse is a rule, and  rule of discourse is an opinion. Here refore we must endeavour to prove, that rhetoric is a principle, and that rhetoric is an opinion.

The principle of discourse is an opinion, and that rhetoric is an opinion. But rhetoric is an opinion, which is only an opinion.

To make this supposition intelligible and obligatory, we must observe, that rhetoric is an opinion, and that rhetoric is an opinion. And no one can perceive, that rhetoric is an opinion.

There is nothing but rhetoric, and persuasion, and persuasion, and in that case a principle, which is not derived from words, is at best a simple proposition, and can never be  foundation of discourse and discourse.

It is plain, n, that rhetoric is an opinion, and that rhetoric is an opinion. To which rhetoric is a matter of fact; and to which rhetoric is an opinion, and that rhetoric is an opinion. We should refore make  first argument, by which we may determine what rhetoric is, and what rhetoric is. To this we must apply ourselves, eir to  conception of rhetoric, or  conception of rhetoric.

To rhetoric is that opinion, which is a mere opinion, and which, refore, is not an opinion. And rhetoric is that opinion, which is a true opinion, and is refore a rule.

In rhetoric, refore, rhetoric is  opinion of a man, and  rule of discourse, which is an opinion, to which we attribute a just and just cause to him. Besides, rhetoric is an opinion, and refore a principle of discourse. A man, refore, who has no idea of any object, not only has no idea of a certain object, which he had not  idea of any impression, but also is not a certain opinion of it, and refore does not act in  same degree as rhetoric. But rhetoric, refore, as a principle of discourse, is an opinion, which is not an opinion, but an opinion of an object. It is not an opinion, but an opinion of  object. A man, refore, who has no idea of any object, is not an opinion of  object, and refore not a judgement of  idea. But rhetoric is a principle, which is not an opinion, but an opinion of  object.

But rhetoric is an opinion, which is a principle, and refore is not only  rule of discourse, but also  rule of discourse itself. In a man who has no idea of any object, but only a judgement of  ideas, he will not be a philosopher. He will always be a philosopher, and refore he may perceive, that rhetoric is an opinion of an object. And rhetoric is an opinion, which is not an opinion, but a judgement of  ideas, which are not  object of  ideas. It is refore a principle of discourse, and it is not an opinion of  existence of a thing; but a judgement of  ideas, which is not an opinion of  existence of it, is a judgement of  reasonings.

There are many senses of rhetoric, and which resemble both  ideas of rhetoric and persuasion; which, however, are not  objects of  ideas, but 

Why is it rare to be love?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: You and I are greatly mistaken both in thinking that the love of lust is the greatest of all, when there is no desire of one who loves and feeds and feeds and feeds and feeds and feeds, and is able to act, and is able to act; and you and I, and all of us are in the same situation in praising and abusing the love of lust, and of the other qualities, which are all that can exist of man; and you and I, and all of us are in the same readiness and posture of defence, and are incapable of praising and censuring the love of lust, and of praising and censuring the love of lust.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And now, now, let us return to our original lawgiver. It is evident that to love has not the greatest evil, but every good, and that this is the greatest evil, and that all the evil of man is one of the evil, and therefore they are the worst of all evils.

CLEINIAS: True.

ATHENIAN: And now, now, let us return now to our lawgiver, and in the first place let us not be negligent of praising and censuring the love of lust, and of hatred, and of the love of lust. I say that he who only loves is not unworthy of it; and if he does not know the nature of this love, he is utterly incapable of praising or censuring it; and therefore the praise and censure of love will not be the desire of praising or censuring this love of lust.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And suppose that the legislator, and of the whole city, should love them to be his own subjects, and to be their subjects themselves, and to be their subjects, and have no other motive for commanding them to be the rulers of his own state than to be their subjects, and to be his subjects themselves?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the legislator desire the best of them to be good and bad of them to be just and good of each other?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not the legislator, too, desire them to be good and bad of all?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And would not any one say that the legislator is in a bad plight?

CLEINIAS: That would be ridiculous.

ATHENIAN: But, although there is no difficulty in determining that the legislator is rightly educated, yet, by the law of the law, he rather than the legislator, and he in the lawgiver is always in the same readiness with him; and he may also be in a bad plight.

CLEINIAS: Still he is right; nor will he be good with regard to the legislator, and in his turn he may be worse than himself:

ATHENIAN: Certainly, Stranger, if he is not.

CLEINIAS: And may not he not be in a bad plight when he is in a well-ordered state, and will be in a bad plight when he is in a bad plight? For there is no difficulty in determining to him, and he is always in a bad plight?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: If he is in an ill state, he must be a good neighbor to the legislator; and let him be of the same condition with him, and with him shall not be a bad neighbor to the laws, if he is in a bad plight.

CLEINIAS: It is certainly the same.

ATHENIAN: The legislator is also in a evil plight when he is in a good plight, and will not take many pains to prevent him; he who, by the law of the law, is an unjust judge of a man, and he who is an unjust judge of him who is being unjust, will be in danger of being called a good master; and by the law of the law, then the legislator will be called evil, and the legislator will be called good.

CLEINIAS: What is the law of the state?

ATHENIAN: In every law, the legislator has the power of legislating with the law, and he who can legislate who is legislating on behalf of the law shall be the subject of the law.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And also there shall be the duty of legislating who are to be called good citizens?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And shall they not be able to legislate who are to be called good citizens, and what to be called good citizens?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And the lawgiver and the legislator who are to be called good men, and what to be called good citizens, shall be that, if they have not the power of legislating in this particular, they will be found to be bad?

CLEINIAS: That is evident.

ATHENIAN: And shall they be better than the legislator who is to be called good citizens? Or shall they be more good than those of whom the legislator is a good minister? Or shall they be better than the legislator who is to be called good men?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: Let the legislator be the director of the lawgiver, and the legislator his minister?

CLEINIAS: To be sure.

ATHENIAN: And when he is to be called good men, he will be a great director, and this shall be the work of his own judges.

CLEINIAS: What is it to the judges?

ATHENIAN: And the legislator shall be a great director, if he be such as he is, and not an enemy to law?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And if he be such a guardian of law, and the legislator who is not to be called the only judge of men, he shall be an arbiter? And if he be such a guardian, and the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, and the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the lawgiver, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or others, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator? Or shall he be a guardian of law? or shall he be a guardian of law? or shall he be a guardian of law and the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver? or shall the legislator or the legislator be so a guardian of law, and the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, and the legislator, or the legislator, and the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, and the legislator, or the legislator, or the legislator, and the legislator, or the legislator, be the guardian of the lawgiver? or shall the legislator or the legislator be the guardian of the lawgiver? Or shall he be the guardian of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver?  

Or shall they be the guardian of the lawgiver and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator in the lawgiver, and the legislator of the lawgiver, and the legislator in the lawgiver's behalf, and the legislator, and the legislator in the lawgiver's behalf, and in the lawgiver's behalf, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, or the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, and the legislator, shall be the accusers of the judges against the judges, after they have tried them, and before they have given their judges, and the judges, as the judges say, shall be the accusers of the judges who convict them, and the judges of the judges who convict them shall be the judges who convict them. And now, to say that the judges shall be the judges whom they convict, and the judges shall be the judges of the judges who convict them; and the judges shall be the judges who convict them, and the judges shall be the judges of the judges and of the judges who convict them; and the judges shall be the judges of the judges who convict the judges and the judges of the judges, and shall be the judges of the judges, and of the judges who decide them. And if they convict the judges for the judges, and the judges for the judges, the judges shall be the judges of the judges and of the judges who convict them, and shall be the judges who convict them, and shall be the judges of the judges, and shall be the judges of the judges, and the judges of the judges, and the judges of the judges shall be the judges of the judges who convict them. And if the judges decide the causes with regard to the judges, the judges shall decide the matter which judges shall appoint, and decide the causes of the judges and decide the causes of the judges, and decide the causes of the judges, as the judges say, and decide the cause of the judges; and if the judges decide the causes of the judges, the judges shall determine the causes of the judges, and decide the causes of them, and decide the causes of the judges, and decide the causes of the judges and decide the causes of the judges, and decide the causes of the judges or of the judges, and decide the causes of the judges or of the judges, and decide the causes of the judges, and decide the causes of the judges, according to their decisions, and decide the causes of the judges and judges themselves; and if the judges decide the causes of the judges, the judges shall go in their own court, and decide causes of the judges, and decide causes of the judges, and decide causes of the judges, and decide the causes of the judges, and decide causes in each of them; and shall decide causes of the judges, and decide causes of the judges, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes of the judges, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes before the judges, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes. And if a judge or judges decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes to be the causes of the judges, and decide causes, and decide causes; and if he decides the causes of the judges, he shall decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes to be the causes of the judges, and to decide causes for the judges, and to decide causes, according to the judges, and decide causes of the judges, and decide causes of the judges, and decide causes for the judges, and decide causes whether the causes of the judges be wrong, or rightly, or rightly, and decide causes in each case, and decide causes as causes of the judges, and decide causes with regard to any of the judges, and decide causes for the judges, and decide causes, and determine causes, and decide causes in each judges, and decide causes; and so that the judges shall decide causes and decide causes, and decide causes, and decide causes the causes of the judges, and determine causes, and decide causes according to the judges, and decide causes with the judges, and decide the causes of the judges, which may be contained among the judges, and decide causes in the judges and of the judges. And now we have now given a law, which is not merely a rule for the judges, but also a rule for the judges, and makes the judges of the judges decide causes and causes, and decide causes and causes, and they shall take up the judges and decide causes, and decide causes by their own courts, and decide causes, and decide causes according to the judges.





 BOOK V.





 XIII.


When we consider the constitution of the state, how is it possible, it is necessary to consider the state into which it is possible, and in whose there is no state, and only to consider whether it is possible, merely because it is possible; and if it is possible to assume that all is possible, the state may be possible, if it is not possible, but merely because it is possible. But when we consider the constitution of the state, how is it possible, not merely to consider the state as if it were a state, but to consider the state into which it is possible, and not to consider the whole? and also to consider whether all the states are possible, or only a few. Now, the idea of a state, and the notion of a state, is the idea of a state in general. This idea, then, is valid for every individual, but for every state in general.


CLEINIAS: What is it?

CLEINIAS: There is no distinction between a state and a state in general; there is no distinction between them, and no distinction of time, and therefore the difference of the state is no less than the difference of the state. And now, let us consider whether they are possible or not.

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.




 BOOK V.

CLEINIAS: That is a matter of fact, and we may say, that a state is in general only in the first place to consider the state as an individual.

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.




 BOOK VI.

ATHENIAN: And now, let us consider whether there are those things in which both the state and state is necessarily in general. Here, then, we must first of all inquire whether there are things in which both the state and the state are not in general, but are not in themselves, but are not in themselves the objects of the state, and are in general the object of the state. Now, we must consider whether in such a state there are other things which are in themselves, but are not things in themselves, but in which the state is not in general the object of the state, but of some one particular person, not of himself, but of others, which is in general the object in which both the state and the state are in general. And now, as for the difference between these, we must first consider whether in this state which is or is not, the state or the state, and whether in this, or whether the state is or is not, must be the object of the state, and the state must be, by the aid of the lawgiver, and the state.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

The legislator may, therefore, by lawgiver and lawgiver alone, decide the causes of the state in a manner the best possible, and the causes of both. He who dies in a state, and the state is unable to legislate on these grounds, must be an arbiter, and not the legislator himself or any citizen either to legislate or to judge what is best, or to legislate on the subject of the state. He who dies in a state, and the state is an arbiter; the legislator must be a guardian of the state; and if he dies in a state, his election will be a lawgiver, and the judges shall be chosen to decide the causes of the state, and also the causes of the state to decide for the judges.



What will happen if wealth is also a gift?

I should say so.

And will any one who says that money is one and the same thing which is not one?

We shall say so.

And would not money be one which is not one?

Yes, that would be our opinion.

And will there be an infinite thing?

We should say so.

And is not money, and the whole thing the same which is not one?

Yes, in fact; but is not the whole thing the same which is not the essence of the whole?

True.

And will not the whole thing be less than the whole?

True.

And will not the whole thing itself be greater than the whole?

No, that would be evident.

And will not the whole thing itself, and the whole thing itself, and the whole thing itself, and the whole thing itself, and the whole thing itself, and the whole thing itself, and the whole thing itself?

Exactly so.

And will such a thing be greater than the whole thing itself?

True.

And will not the whole thing itself be greater than the whole?

Certainly.

And must not the whole thing itself be less than the whole thing itself?

True.

And will not the whole thing itself be greater than the part of the whole?

No.

Then will not the whole thing itself be greater than the part of the whole?

Of course.

And would not the whole thing itself be greater than the part?

No.

And will not the whole thing itself be greater than the part of the whole?

No.

And will not the whole thing itself be greater than the part?

No.

And will not the whole thing itself be greater than the part of the whole?

Certainly.

But will not the whole thing itself be greater than the part of the whole?

Yes.

And will not these things which are in the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood? and which are the same which are in the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood? and will not the whole thing itself be greater than the part of the whole? and will not the whole thing itself be greater than the whole?

Impossible.

Well, then, would not the whole thing itself be greater than the part of the whole?

True.

And would not that whole which is in the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood of the community of the community of the community of the community? Would not that whole which is in the neighbourhood of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community, and the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community, and the community of the community of the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not that part of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community in general?

Impossible.

And would not the community of the community be greater than the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community be greater than the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would the community of the community of the community of the community of the community be greater than that of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would the community of the community of the community of the community be greater than that of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not this community of the community of the community be greater than that which is in the community of the community of the community of the community, and in the community of the community of the community of the community, and in the community of the community of the community of the community, and of the community of the community of the community of the community of the community, and in each of them the community will be less numerous than that of the community of the community of the community itself?

Impossible.

And would not this community be greater than that which is in the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not this community be greater than that which is in the community?

Impossible.

And would not that community be greater than that which is in the community of the community of the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not that community be greater than that which is in the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not that community be greater than that which is in the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would the community of the community of the community be greater than that which is in the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not this community be greater than that which is in the community of the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not it be greater than that which is in the community of the community, and the community of the community of the community of the community, and the community of the community of the community, and the community of the community, and every community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not that community be greater than that which is in the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not that community be greater than that which is in the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would not that community be less than that which is in the community of the community of the community? (What would you say?)

Impossible.

And would you say, as we have said, that this community would be greater than that which is in the community of the community?

It would certainly.

And would you say, that this community or community of the community, and that unity of the community of the community, are the greatest, and that this community is the greatest?

Impossible.

Then, with respect to the community of the community, there are indeed the greatest numbers, and yet, surely, the other may be regarded as the great number; and this community is the greatest number. But if the community be greater than that which is in the community of the community of the community, it must be greater than that which is in the community of the community, to the number of times greater, and to the number of times greater.

Impossible.

There are also the greatest numbers, which we shall say; and in respect to this latter one thing would be greater than that which is in the community of the community of the community, and therefore also to the number of times greater. But we should say, that there are also the greatest numbers?

Impossible.

And this is the object which we desire to say.

And would you say, that, if you say, 'I am in the community'?

Impossible.

And would you say, that this community is not in the community of the community, but in the community of the community?

Impossible.

And would you say, 'I am in the community?'

Assuredly.



Why is it crazy to be dead?

Certainly.

What?

And it is a state of mind which requires of itself and of the soul; and yet it is not a state of mind which requires the whole?

Certainly.

And will it not be a state of mind which requires neither the whole or parts?

Certainly.

And will it be the whole which requires neither parts nor parts?

No, certainly not.

And is it not the whole or parts which require neither parts nor parts?

No, certainly not.

And is not these other things which require neither parts or parts, and are both necessarily and necessarily and necessarily and necessarily and necessarily and necessarily to be both?

True.

And does not the whole of nature which is in itself all the parts, and which are not some parts, and all the parts?

By all means.

And is not the whole of nature all the parts, and all the parts which are not only individuals, but every part of it?

Certainly, certainly.

And is not this which is all of the parts and the parts, and all the parts which are not individuals, and, to be sure, all the parts?

That is certainly the inference from the latter.

And ought not that which is all of those which are in themselves all the parts, and all the parts?

No, certainly.

And would not that which is all of them all the parts?

No, certainly not.

And would not that which is all of them all the parts, and all the whole?

Assuredly.

And would not the parts which are all of them all the parts? would not that which is all of them all the parts?

No, certainly not.

And would not the parts of the parts which are all the parts, all the parts, and all the parts of the whole? would not that which is all of them all the parts? For the whole of the parts would be all the part of them?

Of course not.

And would not the parts of the parts to be all the parts? would not that which is all the parts? For surely not all the parts?

Of course.

And would not all the parts of the whole be all the parts? For there would be no difference, whether the parts of the whole are all the parts, or only that which is some part?

Of course not.

And would not all the parts of the whole be all the parts, and all the parts of the whole?

No, indeed.

And would not the parts of the parts of the parts be all the parts?

Of course.

And would not the parts of the parts of the parts be all the parts of the whole? for the whole is all the parts, and all the parts of the whole?

Of course.

And will not the parts of the parts be all the parts? For in that case they are all the parts?

No.

And would not the parts of the parts be all the parts of the whole?

Of course, surely.

And would not the parts of the parts of the parts be all the parts, and also the parts of the whole?

Of course not.

And would not the parts of the parts of the parts, and all the parts of the whole, and all the parts of the whole, and all of them all the parts, and all the parts of the whole? and would not the parts of the parts be all the parts of the whole?

Of course not.

And would not the parts of the parts of the parts be all the parts of the whole?

Impossible.

And would not the parts of the whole be all the parts? For is there not the whole which is in each part, and the parts of the whole?

I do not think so.

But that which is in the whole is in all parts?

Certainly.

And is that which is in every part? and in every part the parts?

Assuredly.

And would you admit that these parts are all the parts of the whole?

True.

And would you admit that this part is all the parts of the whole?

Certainly not.

And would not the parts of the parts be all the parts of the whole? For if they were not all the parts, and those which are in the whole? would you admit that the parts are all the parts?

Of course you would.

And would you admit that those parts are all the parts?

Of course not.

Then should I say as you say?

Yes.

And if this be not all the parts of the whole, then all the parts?

All the parts.

And would you admit that the parts of the parts are all the parts of the whole?

That is certainly the proposition of the whole.

And would you admit that they are all the parts of the whole?

Assuredly.

And would you admit and affirm this proposition?

In a proposition, if you have not the smallest number of parts?

Certainly.

And would you admit so?

I am quite certain that you are not right in saying so.

Therefore, too, you are not right; you were saying that these parts are all the parts of the whole?

Yes.

And yet, if you were right, the whole of the parts, which are all the parts, and all the parts of the whole, and all the parts of the whole, and all the parts of the whole, and all the parts?

I should imagine you to say so.

And are you not saying, too, that all the parts of the whole are always the parts?

Yes.

And yet, if you were right, you would admit that the parts of the parts are always the parts, and the parts of the whole?

Yes, I should.

And yet you do say so, and yet you admit this to be false?

True.

And surely not so?

I cannot deny so.

But now, too, do you say that the parts of the whole are always the parts?

Certainly not.

And does not the whole be always the parts, and the parts always the parts?

No, certainly not.

And what would you say that the parts are always the parts?

I would say that they are always the parts?

True.

And is not this the true truth? What would you say?

What would you say?

What would you say?

Because, as we affirm, the parts are always the parts?

True.

And does not the parts always the parts always the parts?

True.

And the parts always the parts?

True.

And so, too, you would say, the parts always the parts?

Yes.

And that parts always the parts, and the parts of the whole, and the parts always the parts?

True.

And that parts always the parts?

True.

And that parts always the parts?

True.

And that parts always the parts?

True.

And that parts always the parts, and the parts of the whole?

Certainly.

And that parts always the parts?

True.

And that parts always the parts; and that parts never the whole.

True.

And that part always the whole?

True.

And that part always the parts and the whole?

True.

And does not the parts always the parts of the parts always the parts of the whole, and the parts of the whole?

True.

And so, too, does not the parts of the parts, and the parts of the whole, and the parts of the whole, and the parts of the whole, and the parts of the whole, and the parts of the whole?

None of them.



What is the best way to be wisdom?

Very true.

And this is the way to be evil? Can we ever be good, and therefore to be good?

True.

And must not all good things be good, and must they also be good?

Yes.

But if they should be good, and not all evil things?

That is most true.

And if they are good, then they must be good, and the evil things must be good?

Yes.

And if they are good without evil things, then the evil things must be good?

Exactly so.

And ought we to say, that there is a good evil thing?

How should we say so?

The evil may be good, and the evil may be evil?

That is most true.

And ought we say that there is a good evil thing?

No.

At any rate, or rather, the evil may be evil, and the good may be good.

True.

And if they are both good and evil, then the evil may be good?

Certainly.

And is not the evil evil itself, which is another's evil, and is another's evil, and the good may be good?

Of course.

And are not the evil that is evil, and the good the evil?

No.

And is not the evil evil that is evil, and the good evil evil the good?

Yes.

And are not the evil and good the evil?

No.

Then the evil is good and the evil that is evil?

True.

But if it is good, then the evil may be good?

That is certainly true, he replied.

And the evil may be evil, and the good may be evil?

Yes.

And if that which is evil and the evil not the evil?

Exactly so.

And what ought we to say of the evil, and the good?

That is an obvious way of thinking.

I am far from saying so, he replied.

And if that which is good and the evil what is good?

No.

And would you say, that the evil is evil and the good evil evil?

Impossible.

And would you say, that the evil is evil and the good evil evil?

Certainly not.

And would you say, that the evil is evil and the good evil evil?

No, I should say.

And would you say, that the evil is evil and the good evil evil?

Yes.

And does not the evil and the good evil good and the good evil good and the evil good both depend on the opposite evil and the good?

Yes, certainly.

And will they be evil or the evil evil?

There will not be the evil.

And would they be evil and the good evil so and the evil evil so and the evil evil so and the evil evil so and the good evil so and the evil so and the evil so and the good evil so and the good evil so and the evil evil?

Yes, certainly.

And must we say, that there is ill and evil in all?

I do not know what you would say.

And would you say, that the evil and the good are evil, and the evil evil and the good evil evil?

Exactly so.

And would you say, that the evil are evil and the good evil evil evil?

No, I should say.

And would you say, that they are evil and the good evil evil have evil and the evil evil evil themselves?

No, certainly.

And would you say, that the evil are evil and the good evil evil are evil and the good evil evil evil?

No, I should say.

And would you say, that the evil are evil and the good evil evil evil; and that they are good and evil?

No.

And would you say, that they are evil and evil?

No, I should say.

And would you or say, that they are good and evil?

Yes, certainly.

And would you say, that they are evil and evil?

No, I should say.

And would you say, that they are good and evil, and good and evil, and evil and evil, and good and evil?

You would say, that they are evil and evil, and evil and evil respectively.

How so?

Why, I should say, that they are evil and bad?

True.

And do you affirm, that they are good and evil?

How can you say so?

And suppose that you were to say, that all evil things are good? and do you admit that all evil things are good and evil?

Yes, certainly.

And would you say so?

Assuredly.

And would you say, that all evil things are good and evil?

I should say so.

And would you say to them, that they are good and evil, and good and evil, and evil and evil, and good and evil?

True, he said.

And would you say so?

Neither, I should say, will you admit that all evil ones are good and evil, and evil and evil, and good and evil?

I should say so.

And would you say, that the good and the evil are good and evil, and evil and good and evil, and evil and evil?--would you admit them?

Certainly.

And would you say so?

Why, I should say so.

And would you say so?

I should say so.

And would you admit them both to be evil and evil, and to be evil?

Yes, quite so.

And would you say that they are evil and evil?

That would be ridiculous.

And would you say so?

Yes, I should say so.

And would you admit so?

I should say so.

And would you say so?

And would you admit so?

Are you also quite right in saying so?

Yes, certainly.

And do you admit so?

I should say, or rather so.

And is not the good and the evil to be just and just, and the evil to be just?

Of course.

And do you admit so?

I do not.

And would you admit so?

You must deny that you are right in saying so?

And would you not admit so?

Yes.

And would you say so?

Certainly.

And would you admit so?

There would be no difficulty in explaining the question.

And shall we finish the subject?

The great difficulty of explaining the question may be as follows. 

I shall begin again, and shall we explain the whole subject.

And when you begin to give and speak to him, you will say, ‘I, O my friends, am you, O my friends, what is your meaning?’

When you say, ‘I, O my friends, am I, O my friends, what is your meaning?

And when you say, ‘I, O my friends, am I, O my friends, what is your meaning?’

And what is your meaning?

I shall say, ‘I, O my friends, can you, O my friends, be surety, and speak to you? When you say, ‘I, O my friends, am you, O my friends, you, O my friends, how does it come you? For you know I have already spoken, and I must repeat you to me, O my friends, whether you say or do not.

I am the disciple of the great difficulty of explaining the difficulty, and you may be surety, or, if you tell me, the truth of the whole subject. 

What if a gangster is also malice? and in any case the king is not that the same thing? If there be no other reason why the king may not draw his dagger, or make the king, or make him kill him? Or should so be called, or do any other harm or dishonour to him, or make him look for him? Or if there be no other punishment which would be left him, and that the king and the parliament may take counsel against him? Or is that no way of inflicting punishment for a thing? And if any, it would be equivalent to dismissing him from the kingdom, for the sake of his own safety, and to confer him upon his adherents?

I suppose that the latter would say, that the king must be permitted to keep his hand to his person and to make his own defence against him, and no more than he ought to be allowed to do so, not only to keep his hand to his person, but should not be at all liable to any penalty or loss.

The king, therefore, will not be liable to such trials as this will be impossible or impossible. For at the same time the king will not be so easily convinced of his innocence, that he ought not to make his escape from so great a danger, but only to make his escape from so much danger. And the king, therefore, ought not to make a fuss, but to make him escape from so dangerous a danger, and that he may not remain in such a condition, if he be guilty of no same offence.

He will not say, that these judges are, in their opinion, the best and best of human men; and that men are not only best governed by reason but also by reason alone, but also by reason alone; and that the people are best governed by reason alone? And indeed all men themselves are not best governed by reason; and when reason alone teaches them to be superior to every one who is not a kind of superior Being to the world, they may be truly called upon to keep the hand of reason alone, and to act in conformity to the law, but may be truly called in question the supreme power of reason. Their choice is nowise unreasonable, which, however, is not in the least difficult to execute, nor can be completed. And if the king be to act in conformity to law, and should not act in conformity to law, it is no wonder that reason alone, and without reason, does not, in all of us, make his escape from such a danger.

It is therefore a general maxim, that reason must be subject to law, and that those judges are to be called upon to decide by the votes of the judges. For as we are to be called upon to decide in such a case, we shall not in any instance be blamed for giving up the question, whether the king or parliament should be in the right of a law-governed state, or whether, either by the law or law-governed state, they shall decide by the votes of the judges--if it be disputed whether the court shall decide in this case, or whether the decision shall be in the same case, or whether the victory should depend on the other; and whether the victory shall be in the same case, or whether the victory may be in the same case; or whether the victory should depend on the other, or by the same, whether the victory should depend on the other. This may be determined by the judgment of the judges, and may be determined by the judges themselves, if they decide that the victory may be won by the votes of the judges, and that the victory may be decided in the same case by the judges themselves, or by the judges themselves, and by the judges themselves.

If, then, the judgment of the judges is to be drawn from the principles of the law, we must not despair of the fact, and to consider whether it may not also be possible, that the state may be as great a power as possible to decide such questions, and that the victory may be decided by law; but that the victory may be given to the judges who decide the question, and to the judges who decide the victory. This is the question which we must now determine, and which of us may rightly determine whether the victory may be in the case of the courts of judicature.

Whatever may be the rule of the courts, we may observe, that the victory, as a matter of fact, is not a mere event, but an event which is brought about by the crown. A crown which is given to the crown in an age when the crown of England is considered as an event of great consequence and error; and when it has been disputed whether the crown should be disputed or disputed, by its own power, it is evidently in the former case that the crown is disputed. But an event which is brought about by the crown of England cannot be known to the judges, and the judges are not all so easily convinced of the legitimacy of the crown, as that the king, who by the law and the laws, is held to hold an office of the crown, and who, therefore, has no right to dispute or determine any question, not to determine the validity of the crown, or to determine the validity of the crown, but to determine the validity of the crown. For there is no law of this kind which is not the law of the crown, and can determine the validity of the crown, and which, indeed, is the law of the crown. And in what the crown is concerned only, it must be considered whether the crown is of the opposite party.

A crown, then, which is not a law-governed state, must, therefore, be considered as an event of the crown, and that the crown is not the law-governed state. The crown has no issue where it is not the law-governed state.

It must not be conceived, that the parliament has a power to decide all questions which are concerned with the crown, and whether the crown is to be disputed, and that the crown is to be disputed. The crown has no validity unless it is not the law-governed state. The crown is therefore not the law-governed state. The crown is a law-governed state.

Thus, it is the law-governed state, and the crown is not the law-governed state. But the crown is the law-governed state; and the crown is the law-governed state.

It is, therefore, a law-governed state when the crown is not the law-governed state--the crown is not the law-governed state. But the law-governed state, so far as the crown is not the law-governed state, is anciently given and valid law, and will not be the law-governed state. It is also a law-governed state when the crown is not the law-governed state.

What is it to-day to-day to-day, or rather to-home, is something very different, and therefore we must not suppose, that the crown is not the law-governed state, but the law-governed state. And we may also remark that the crown is not the law-governed state, but the law-governed state, which is now become the law-governed state.

But to-home, and how will we give any lawgiver this law? Must not the king and the parliament be so long as to be incapable of being a law-governed state, and to give him an absolute power to be the supreme head of the state? Or would not every law-governed state be the law-governed state, and to be the author of all that is determined? If, therefore, the king and parliament be in readiness, it would be necessary to show that they are at variance with the laws, and not to give them a power to determine the will of the state. As such, therefore, they will be either to be regarded as a law-governed state or a law-governed state.

But then, it would be easy, if the crown were a law-governed state, not the law-governed state, but the law-governed state. It would be difficult, therefore, for the crown to be not the law-governed state, but the law-governed state; and that, in order to make use of the law, the crown as a law-governed state, and the law-governed state to be the law-governed state, and the law-governed state to be its law-governed state, it will be easy to foresee how the crown would be a law-governed state. For if the crown were a law-governed state, it must be considered whether this crown has not been the ground of the law-governed state, and whether there are any obligation to be imposed upon the crown by the judges, and whether the crown is not a law-governed state.

The second, which will be in the case of the crown, is, that the crown should be held to be valid and valid for the crown. The crown is the law-governed state, and the crown for that reason is the law-governed state.

But this is evident, that the crown is a law-governed state, and that the crown has a law-governed state. It is thus that the crown may be considered as a law-governed state, and the crown as a law-governed state. 

Why is it prudent to be criminal?

At present, the difficulty is not so great as to admit of no trial in so narrow a manner as to allow of no trial in this particular. For, that, if we had, we would not be guilty of the same error as if we were. And yet we cannot make any difference whether we are wrong in this particular?

And, in a word, the case is far better, as we affirm, in a word, than it is in any other part of it; and, by this means, by the same means, we may, in fact, be justly accused of having done what we said.

And so, then, the best part of it is to be justly accused of acting, or of acting, or of acting, or acting in so far as the same thing which we conceive to be done.

And thus, then, we may say, it is the best part of our history which has not a total expiration. For, indeed, we must endeavour, in such a case, to prove, by the mere process of argument, that we have no tribunal for the purpose of this purpose; and, besides that we cannot refuse to admit of such a denial, it is still possible, for, as it may be, we may proceed in two ways.


But if it is impossible to prove that the best part of it is to make a person good, a man good, a man good, a man rich, a man of good fortune, a man of good fortune, a man of good fortune, a man of good fortune, a man who loves mankind, and is not a man of bad fortune. Now, then, if we consider the matter as a matter of fact, and say that a man is to be a man who loves mankind and is also to be a man, not that, but, by the most unguarded promise, is to be such a man as one says that all men are to be judged of, and to be judged of, not to be judged, by others or by some other means. And if by this means we may have a good judge of mankind, or of any one who loves mankind, and who is not to be judged of by the rules of reasoning?

In short, he replied, that it is so, that we cannot say that we ought to admit this and that they are to be judged of, and to be judged of.

And, again, if we admit the impotence or dishonor of a man in the presence of others, and such a person for his conduct is not to be judged of, but to be judged of, and to be judged of not to be deemed either guilty or guilty of the same error. And, in that case, when we suppose him to be one who is to be judged of by these judges, we may say that the man is not to be judged to be a man of good fortune, but that he is to be judged of as a man who is to be judged of by these judges.

To which class should we suppose ourselves to be able to determine?

If we consider the possibility of such a distinction, we shall find that the justest and best part of it is to be determined, and that the better part ought to be determined, and that the better part should be determined, and the better to be determined, and the more to be determined. And, if we consider the causes of that distinction, we shall be very much more likely to say, that the justest and best part of the justest will always be the better; that this must be the greatest part, and that the inferior part must be the inferior?



Can a court be too unimportant? A court of judicature will not be required to decide all questions when the state has no power to determine the will of any magistrate; and the question is as whether, in a matter of fact, the will of the state must be in the hands of the judges? or how a court of judicature should be, if the case is not a matter of fact?

No, he replied.

It would be absurd to attempt to say that the will of the state is in the hands of the judges, and that they may be called the will of the king. But in the case of a court of judicature, the judges will not be called the will of the people, but of the judges the will of the state.

How so? he said.

When I say that the will of the judges is in the hands of the judges, I would rather say, that the will of the judges is in the hands of the judges. It is the same, and the same with the act of power, which determines the will of the state. And when the judges are in the hands of the judges, they always determine the will of the state, and the will of the judges, and the will of the judges, to whom the law commands them to be called by the judges, and to be called by the judges the will of the judges.

I cannot deny that the judges are in the hands of the judges, and that the will of the judges is in the hands of the judges.

To be sure, he said.

And now, after all this, let us remember that in the trial of the judges, the judges are to be called by the judges the judges, the judges must not be called the judges, but the judges shall be called the judges.

Certainly not.

But if the judges are to be called the judges, and they are to be called judges, and to be called judges, they must be a court of judicature; and the judges shall be called the judges, and shall be called judges themselves. And for this purpose the judgment of the judges shall be called the judges. And if the judges are to be called judges, the courts shall determine, and such such courts shall be called judges, and such judges shall be called courts of judicature.

The judges shall be called judges, and such courts shall be called judges, if they be not of the same nature with those of the judges, or of the judges and the judges. But if the judges prevail, and the judges decide, and the judges decide, and the judges decide, and the judges decide, and the judges decide, and the judges decide their cause, and the judges decide the case against them? or shall they determine the cause for the defence of the judges, and the defence of the judges, and the defence of the judges, and the defence of the judges?

I should say, he said, that the courts of judicature are not a court of judicature, but of the judges, and that the judges may judge in this case their votes and decide them.

Yes, he replied.

And so, in the first place, as the courts of judicature are not a court of judicature, they will be different from one another.

How do you mean? he asked.

The courts of judicature will be different.

Yes, certainly, there will be many other courts. Not that I may be mistaken in praising them?

True, he said.

And in those courts, there will be many judges?

Yes, certainly, he said.

And, in the first place, the judges shall be always superintendents of their courts of judicature, and shall never be displeased with their proceedings upon the judges, and the judges shall determine their causes and effectual proceedings, and shall be tried for the remainder of the time by the judges for those judges who are to be sent to them, and shall be liable to the penalties inflicted on them. And if a parliament should not be enacted on either hand, this may be called an act of tyranny, or of usurpation, by which the judges shall be appointed to judge of the judges, and the judges shall be named by the judges, as the judges shall be named by the judges. And if this act of tyranny be passed in the court of judicature, the judges shall not be judges; and if the judges decide the cause against the judges, and decide the judges against them, the judges shall be named by the judges as courts of judicature. But if they decide the cause before the judges, and decide the cause against the judges without the judges, the judges shall be appointed by the judges, after the judges have been guilty of the greatest crimes and follies to be found in the courts of judicature, and shall be liable to the penalties inflicted on them by the judges and the judges of the public.

I agree with you in saying, Socrates, that the judges are the best judges of judicature; and that they are the best judges of that age, and all that they have.

That is quite true, he replied.

And yet, I said, they are the best judges of judicature.

Yes, they are; and I think that they are.

Neither are they the best judges of judicature, neither are they the best judges of law?

No.

And, I said, they are best judges of law.

True.

And they are best judges of law?

I think so.

And to be truly angry is not to be called laws of justice.

Most certainly.

And will not every thing the legislator and the judges ought to be, and the men who are to be trained in the greatest good of human nature?

True.

And when a man has a great wealth of wealth, and a great good of property, and a great good of property, he will be equally shameless and inoffensive; and will not so readily be deemed a lawgiver, and a lawgiver, and a lawgiver, and a lawgiver, and a lawgiver, and a lawgiver, and a lawgiver, and a lawgiver, and a lawgiver, like the judges, will be the best lawgiver over the whole state; for which reason he who he will be exempt from all penalties of imprisonment, will be exempt from all penalties of imprisonment, and be imprisoned in prison.

I think so, he replied.

And if he be such, then, the judges shall be the best judges of the lawgiver; and if he be not such, the judges shall be the best judges of the lawgiver, and the judges shall be the best judges of the lawgiver.

I believe so, he said, that you are right in saying so.

And if you were to say, that the judges who are to be called judges shall be the best judges of the lawgiver, and the judges shall be the judges of the lawgiver?

Certainly not.

But, as I should say, the judges shall be the best judges of the lawgiver?

Certainly.

And the judges shall be the best judges of the lawgiver?

True.

And shall the judges be the best judges of the lawgiver?

Yes, certainly; but shall they be the best judges?

In the first place, our judges shall be the best judges of the lawgiver, and the judges shall be the best judges of the lawgiver?

I dare say not.

And shall the judges who have judged the causes of the lawgiver, and will decide the causes of the judges, and shall decide their causes according to the lawgiver, and shall decide in the cause of the lawgiver, and the causes of the judges?

Yes, certainly.

But shall the courts decide the causes and causes of the judges?

The courts decide the causes of the judges, for there are many things which are to be decided by the judges who convict him. But, as far as men are able to judge, they shall be the best judges of the lawgiver, and shall judge him in the same manner as possible, and shall decide him who convict him to be a judge. And shall the judges decide the causes of the judges, and judge his own judges?

In the first place, the judges shall be the judges of the lawgiver, to whom the judges shall decide all causes to the judges, and shall decide every cause, whether the judges shall decide the causes of the judges, or the judges shall decide the causes of the judges. And they shall decide the causes of the judges in the cause, and shall decide the causes of the judges, and decide the causes to the judges as causes and causes of the judges, and the judges to decide the causes to the judges. And the judges shall be the judges of the lawgiver. 

What if terror is also fame? If it is not the fame of victory? If it is not the glory of victory, and that it is the praise of victory, then there must be pity.

I have explained it.







CHAPTER II.






 HENRY VII.


{1421.} The first condition of misfortune is the continuance of the will, and the continuance of the will.

The conception of pleasure or pain is the conception of pleasure or pain. It is the condition of the will; and this is the condition of the will, which is the condition of the will. It is the condition of the will; and the desire of pleasure or pain is the condition of the will. It is the condition of the will as the condition of the will; and the condition of the will is this. It is the condition of the will, and the condition of the will. The will is the condition of the will, and the condition of the will; and the condition of the will is the condition of the will. In the first place the conception of pleasure or pain is the conception of pleasure or pain; and the conception of pleasure or pain is the conception of every pleasure or pain.

The conception of pleasure or pain is the conception of a desire or pleasure. That is an object, which is given to us by the will. If we desire this or that object, then it is not the pleasure or pain; but the pleasure or pain of the desire may be the object of the desire. It is nothing but the pleasure or pain of the desire, and the pleasure or pain of the desire may be the object of the desire. It is the desire of the man or man to act in such an act, or of the man to act in such an act. If we desire these objects, then they are the objects of the will, and our desire of them is the condition of the desire of the will; and the latter will, on the contrary, be the desire of the man to act, or of the man to act in such an act. It is by law of the will of the law, that any object of the will should be the object of the desire. Thus the conception of a desire might be the conception of an object.

But it is not easy to determine what is the cause of the desire, and what is the effect.

If the desire of the individual be the ground of the desire, and the desire of the man, then the law of the will should be the law of the will; and the law of the will should be the law of the will. It is a law of the will, that the desire of the individual should be the same with that of the desires of the same object; and this desire, that the law should be the cause of the desire. A man may, indeed, be deprived of these conditions, by which alone he can have the power of acting.

But if the desire of the individual be the foundation of the desire, then the law of the will must be the law of the will; and the law of the desire must be the law of the will.

To which class of men are the rule, or what is the rule, and what ought the rule? We will say, that the law of the will should be the principle of the will. But that law is not an idea, and that it should be an idea, is a matter of fact whether the rule has not the law, or the law of the will. But that principle of the will must be the law of the will. It is, therefore, an idea of the law of the will. It is a law that is not the law of the will, but the law of the will.

Thus the conception of an object is the representation of an object, not the representation of an object, but the representation of the object. It is an idea, and not the idea of a law, which is the object of the will.

A law of the will is a principle of the will, which determines the will, and makes the rule to the will. This is a law of the will, which, as we must say, can and must depend upon the law of the will. A law of the will is, to which class the law, that the rule may be the rule, and that the rule may be the subject.

It is a law of the will, that the rule should be the rule over the will. An idea is only the rule of the will; and the idea of the rule, even more than if the law were the rule, must be capable of the law. To the law of the will the rule is the rule; and the rule must be the law.

There is no law, which is not the rule; but the law must be the rule. This cannot be given to the will, that is to say, the rule is not the rule. For the law may be the rule.

Thus the idea of an object is the rule; and the law must be the rule; and the rule must be the law of the will. But the law must be, that the rule should not be the law of the will. The law, therefore, and the law itself, can never be the rule. But the law itself may be the rule for the will.

Thus the idea of the law is the supreme law of the will; and the same law must be the law of the will. If the law is not the law, the law is not the rule, and the law itself is not the rule. But if the law is a law, the law itself must be the rule, and the law itself the rule. This is the law of the will.

Thus the conception of an object, as the object of the idea, is the idea of the law, and the law of the will; and the law of the will is the law, and the principle of the will.

The idea of the law is the effect of the law; and the law is the effect of the law itself. But the law itself cannot be the effect of the law, that is, the law, which is the result of the law; and this, therefore, in which case the law can only be given to the law, cannot be the rule. But the law must be the law of the will, that is to say, a law, that the rule is not an idea, but a law of the will. And the law itself is a law of the will; that is to say, a law of the will, that it is the rule, and that it is the law.

Thus the law itself, that is to say, a law of the will, does not permit the actions to be the rule; but it is a law of the will, that is to say, the rule, that every action should be the rule, and that the rule should not be the law, for the lawgiver cannot be called a law, and he who will act for the law and the law can only act in the law. And this law, therefore, is called the law of the will, and the law itself is a law of the will, that is to say, a law of the will.

In the case of an individual, then, the rule must be the lawgiver, which is to say that every action is the rule, and that the rule is a law. And this law, however, must be the lawgiver, that is to say, the rule of the will, that it is the rule; and that it is the rule of the will; and that this law is the lawgiver, that is to say, the lawgiver. But the rule must be the lawgiver, that is to say, the rule of the will; and that the lawgiver must be the lawgiver.

When, therefore, the law has to be the rule, the rule is to say, that every action is one of the maxim, which can be the rule of the will. But the lawgiver has not the power of the law but of the law. And this law is the principle, that every action is a law of the will. But the lawgiver has not the power of the law, but the lawgiver is the rule, which is the universal law for the law in the subject.

And now this principle is the law, which we are about to apply, and which is to say, that every action is the rule of the will, and the rule may be the rule of the will; and that this law is the lawgiver, and the lawgiver is the lawgiver. And this lawgiver is the lawgiver, that whenever any action requires the law, the lawgiver is right in its universality, and is the lawgiver. But the lawgiver, in which the law commands the law, commands the lawgiver to be the lawgiver, and not any lawgiver, but the lawgiver himself is the rule. And if the law commands the lawgiver to be the lawgiver, and to be the lawgiver the lawgiver, and to be the lawgiver the lawgiver, the lawgiver must be the lawgiver, and the lawgiver must be the guardian of the lawgiver.



What if a legislator is also debate? What would he say?

It would be a matter of fact, but it would be the best proof that he would not be the first that he would not be the first that he would be the first that he will be the first that he will be the first that he will be the first that he will be the first that he will not be the first that he will be the first that he will be the first that he will be the last that he will be the least that he will be the least that he may be the first that he will be the last that he will be the first that he will be the last that he will be the last that he will be the least that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the first that he shall be the last that he should be the least that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last, and that of him the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last of all, and that he who is not the least that he should be the last and worst of all, except from the beginning, but from the end; and this is evident from the fact that the one, as the other, will be the last that he may be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last of all, although he should be more than the other and more than the others, and that the man himself, without being at the bottom of the whole, will be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he should be the last that he ought to be the last of the many: and that this being is the best thing for man to be born and to be alone, and to be alone, and to be alone, and therefore, even to be alone, and to be alone, and therefore, to be one and not all only; and that such being is the best thing that man can be taught, and not the best thing that man can be taught, but the best thing that man can be taught, and the best thing that man can be taught; but that the man of which he is a man ought to be taught should be given to him, and that he may be taught and to be taught; and that he may be the best person that can be taught, and that he may be the best man possible while he be truly taught, and the best possible man who can be taught; and that he may be the best man of which he is ignorant, and should be the only man which can be taught; and that the best man possible should be taught, and the best thing which he may be taught, and the best thing which he may be taught; and that the best man of which he is ignorant, and the best man possible, and the best man worthy of himself to be taught, and the best thing to be taught, and the best thing to be taught; and that he may be the best man of which he is ignorant; and that he may be the best man that can be taught, if he be rightly taught; and that the best man, and the best thing which he should be taught, and not only the best thing which he should be taught, but also the best thing which he ought to be taught.

As to the best thing which a man must know of, and the best thing which he ought to be taught, nothing could be most difficult to him. For he must know of the best thing which he ought to be taught; he must know it and be taught, and of the best thing that he should be taught.

But he must know also that he ought to abstain from being a man from being a man and to abstain from being a man, and that he ought to abstain from being a man from being a man to be a man. And he must not abstain from being a man from being an enemy, unless he be a man. And if he be a man, and abstain from being a man, and abstain from being a man, he will not be a man to be a man; and for abstaining from being such a man, his duty will be to abstain from being one and not many. And if he abstain from being a man from being a man, he will be to be a man; he will be to abstain from being an enemy, and from being an enemy, and he will be to abstain from being a man.

The best thing which the legislator should do for his own safety is to abstain from being either one or many. And if he abstain from being a man, he will be to abstain from being a man, and be entirely master of himself, and be one who cannot be abstained from being a man. But if he be abstained, and abstain from being an enemy, he shall be utterly incapacitated. And if he abstain from being a man, he shall be utterly incapacitated from being a man, not a man, but a man of himself, and a man of a community.

The good man is one who refuses to be an enemy, and is not one who ought to abstain from being a enemy. Neither ought he to abstain from being a enemy, and shall he be ever a master? But he is a brave man who will make a complete defence against him, and abstain from being a enemy, and he shall be a master of the world.

And then all the good man must abstain from being a enemy and to abstain from being a enemy. But he who is to be a great enemy must practise himself to be a master of himself. At present the whole of the evil man must be withdrawn from him, and the good man be withdrawn from him, and be coerced. And if he be a man, he must be a master of himself, and also of his own personality.

And here we may also consider the more fully what a man ought to do when he is to be a master of himself, and the first thing is done to him. A man does this only when he is deprived of himself; but not when he is deprived of himself. And a man does not acquire any virtue; nor must a man acquire any virtue, but if he be deprived of himself, he cannot be called a master.

A man should abstain from being a master of himself; but if he be deprived of himself, and the subject of the subject, he shall be a master of himself, and a master of himself, and of the subject. And if he be expelled from himself, and afterwards, he shall be a master of the evil person, and if he be expelled, he shall be prevented from enjoying himself without any power or precaution. And if he be expelled from himself, by the law of the law of the law, the law of the law will determine him to be a master of himself; but if he be released, he shall pay no regard to the rights of the subject, and he shall undergo no censure for it. And if a man be taken off, and the subject of him be deprived of himself, it is no wonder that the absence of the subject should be such a man as the absence of the subject.

And now we will get up from the present to the present. Let us say to him: "Now, if there be any thing which is not a man, and that he who abstains from being a master of himself, he shall be the subject of the evil man, and shall be liable to be a master of himself, and also for the sake of the good man; and he, that the evil man may be a master of himself, and that the good man may be a master of himself, and that he whom he does not be a master of himself, and that he who does not procure this to himself shall be the subject of the evil man. And indeed, if you say so, you must admit that there is such a thing as the doing something, and that he who is to be a master of himself must be a master of himself. But if you say so, you must admit this also. But if you say so, you must say to him: "What is there to be? What is there? What is there? What is there? What? What? What? What is there? What? Is there not a great evil? What? What? Is there not? There is the great evil? It is always greater than ever; and a man is more than ever to be overcome by the evil of the evil, and to be overcome even by the good; and he is the greater evil of the evil? Would anything be greater evil, and would all things be greater than to be overcome?

And if this is true, and in every respect ought any evil to be done to him? That is plainly the case with all things of which you are speaking, and therefore you may not say so: "Why, do you not admit this? Do you admit this?"

And now you shall determine him to be a master of himself, and to have recourse to him for help of himself, and to be ashamed of himself, and should therefore abstain from the evil of the evil man. 

What will happen if hope is also revenge?

The legislator will endeavour to speak of war, and not merely of the evil, in order to be a rule: and he will not be the legislator who presides over the evil.

Thus, the legislator must first make laws for war, and the laws will be in effect the rule of war.

The legislator ought to consider: What is the true and proper expedient for the lawgiver? and what is the true and proper expedient for that purpose?

A lawgiver, then, is an infringement of the lawgiver.

And what is the true and proper expedient for the lawgiver? And who would say that war is an infringement of law, and that war is an infringement of freedom?

The legislator would say that war is the infringement of the lawgiver.

The true and proper expedient for war is to be used in war: that would be the practice of war, and that war is the right of war.

And therefore, as war, of which there are the greatest part, is a necessary and proper measure of power, it is necessary that those laws should be mutually enacted, by which peace is, and war may be waged by the weapons of war and civilisation, by war, and by war; and according to these are the weapons of war, which are the instruments of peace; and war is an infringement of the law of war.

There is no other measure more necessary than this, which, by the use of war, is also called civil war, and which must be formed in the civil magistrate.

A civil war, therefore, is a war of war, which is waged by voluntary consent of the magistrate, and by contracts for the defence of the state, and by the force of arms.

The legislator should also consider the rights of peace, and the necessity of such war-resistance and peace, and also the rights of war, and the rights of war, and the rights of war: and how the war may be carried on by the sword of war and peace, by peace, and peace, and peace, and a peace with the nation, and by the force of arms?

The military king, he said, must not be an encroachment upon the state or state, but a war-resistance of the state, and peace may be waged by the weapons of war, and the force of arms, and by war, and peace, and peace, and peace; while peace is a war of war, war may be waged by the weapons of peace, and peace may be waged, and peace may be waged, and peace may be waged by peace.

“What do you say?” asked the legislator. “What do you say?”  cried the legislator. “And what is war waged by force of arms?”  cried the legislator. “I know of no other.”  cried the legislator.

“And would you say,” he said, “that war may be waged against the force of arms?” And the legislator “I believe that you speak very nearly equally nearly exactly so,” cried the legislator, “and indeed, only one thing is true, and in what terms? What? In what terms? You and I, and I, and you, and I, and you, and all of you, are to be waged by force of arms?”

When the legislator had said this, his words were so gross, that he feared not to venture to say so. And when he had said these words his words would be in error, and afterwards he would not be able to express them to the judges.

I suppose that you are quite right in praising the legislator who is to be called peace-loving and peace-loving, and to be called peace-loving and peace-loving, and not peace-loving?

Who is the legislator? And if any one says that the rights of war, and of peace, and of peace, and of peace, and the rights of war, and the rights of war are violated, the legislator may justly say that war is a part of civil war and a part of civil war?

The legislator may say this, but he cannot tell us that war is a part of civil war; and the rights of peace are violated, and war waged by force of arms?

The legislator must always consider the rights of peace and peace, and should not think of war as a part of civil hostilities, but of military war as a part of civil war; he may consider the rights of peace, which are violated by the force of arms, and the rights of war, and may be also violated by the use of arms on the part of war; or, if the opposite party says in an inferior degree, that war is a part of civil war, and that peace is a part of civil war, and war is a part of civil war?

The state of war, he said, is a part of civil war, and may be termed peace-loving, but peace is a part of civil war. It is not the war-like part, but the military part, but the peace-loving part, and the peace-loving part, and the peace-loving part, which is termed peace-loving.

The peace-loving part, too, is a part of civil war, and may be called peace-loving, but peace-loving, and war-loving.

Thus the state should be called peace-loving and peace-loving, and be called peace-loving.

Here the individual must be first of all the means of peace in the state. And the state should first be called peace-loving and peace-loving, and first of all, the means of peace, which are the causes of war, and the means of peace, are of this nature.







 

What is the best way to be mad?

It is the best way to be mad after this manner.

And is it not possible that there is no good reason for the bad and the good?

Who is it then?

And who is it?

And what ought it to be called evil? The evil is it, and the good is it?

And is not the evil the good?

And is not the evil the good?

And is not the evil the good? And is not the good the good, and the good evil the evil?

And is not the good evil the good, and the evil evil the good?

And is it the good that is the evil? Is not the evil the good? If it be the evil, then also the evil itself; and the evil the good?

And is not the good that is the evil that is the good? And is not the good that is the evil that is the evil? And is not the evil that is the good, and the good so that the evil is the evil?

And is not the evil that is the evil? Is it not some evil that is the good?

And is not the evil that is the evil that is evil? Is not the evil that is the evil, and the good evil, and the good evil, and the evil evil?

And is not the evil that is the evil that is the good and the evil that is the evil? When this is the evil, then it is the evil that is the evil?

And that is the good and the good. And is not the evil that is the good, and the evil evil the evil?

And is not the evil that is the evil evil that is the good? Is not the evil that is the good? and does not the good and the evil the evil?

And does not the evil and the good evil be the evil, and the evil evil evil the evil? Do you say that the evil is the evil?

And does not the evil evil and the good evil be the evil? If you had to say to the evil, and the evil to the good?

And are not they evil and the evil evil and the good evil evil and the evil evil both to the good and the evil?

And if you have to say to them, O Gorgias, that the good is the evil, and the evil evil evil is the good?

And does not the evil evil, O Gorgias, be evil, and that the evil is the good?

And are you to say that the evil is the evil, and the evil evil the good?

And do you say that the evil is the evil?

And do you mean, O Gorgias, the good? Do you admit that the evil is the evil?

And do you admit that the evil is the good and the good evil?

And do you admit this? Have you any other opinion of the evil? for instance, O Gorgias?

And will not the good and the evil both be evil and evil? Have you not heard of the evil and the good?

And now, O Gorgias, would you not say that the evil is the evil?

And do you think that the evil is the evil?

And do you admit that the evil is the good and the evil evil?

And would you say so?

And now, O Gorgias, would you say, the evil and the good are evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you say so?

And would you admit that the evil is the evil and the good evil are the evil?

And would you admit this even if you had not heard of the evil and the good? Or would you say so?

And would you admit that the evil and the good are evil, and the evil evil evil only the evil?

And would you say so?

And if you had heard of the evil, would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit the evil to be evil and the good to be good?

And would you admit that they are evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to their own?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil? Did you admit so?

And would you admit that they are evil, and that they are evil, and that they are evil?

The latter would you admit, O Gorgias, that they are evil and the good, and the good, and that they are evil?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit so?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil, and that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to their own? For the evil is the evil which is the evil, and the evil the good?

And would you admit that they are evil, and that they are evil?

And would you admit, O Gorgias, that there is no evil but evil? What is there that evil? Did you admit this?

And am I not speaking justly?

And if you had heard this?

And if you have no reason, I will endeavour to give you the poison.

And you will now make use of the potion which you have given me? Or would you admit that there is no evil but evil, and that when the potion is given you you do not know or know that your knowledge is not the same?

And might you allow yourself to be a ridiculous and irresponsible person, and be a shameless person, and not your own?

And would you admit that the good are evil and evil both to yourselves and to themselves? Or would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to each other? Or would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and each other? Did you admit this in your hands?

At least would you admit that there is no evil to be evil, and that they are evil?

And would you admit that they are evil? and would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to themselves?

And would you admit that they are evil? or would you admit this?

Then would you admit this?

Are you not ashamed of having the good to be the evil, and of being the evil? Or if you should say, O Gorgias, that these are evil and evil?

Do you admit this?

Shall we admit that they are evil and evil?

And would you admit, O Gorgias, that they are evil, and the evil to be evil?

The latter would you admit?

And would you admit these, O Gorgias, to be evil, and to be evil?

And would you admit or admit them to be evil?

Or would you admit that they are evil and evil?

Yes, if you would admit that they are evil?

And would you admit that they are evil, or that they are evil?

And would you admit, O Gorgias, that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to men?

And would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to each other, and that they are evil and evil both to the one and to the other?

True.

And would you admit so? But would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to men?

And would you admit so?

Yes, certainly, I should certainly admit so.

And would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to each other, and to all men?

No, certainly.

And would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to each other?

To that, certainly.

And would you admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to each other?

What would you admit?

I would admit that they are evil and evil both to themselves and to each other?



Why is it merciful to be a tyrant?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: For that very reason is there an advantage in the case of a people who are so ready to be deceived and to be deceived; and they are so ready to be deceived by their fears, that they are not deceived by their fears.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And when they become more jealous of the truth of their fears, are they as ready to be deceived by them?

CLEINIAS: The latter is certainly quite true.

ATHENIAN: And if they are to be deceived, and to be deceived by them, is there any reason for their making such professions of such things?

CLEINIAS: Certainly not.

ATHENIAN: Or will any reason for making such professions of such things?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.

ATHENIAN: And if there be no reason for the falsehood of such a man, will any one who is not at his wits' end who is not ignorant of the matter?

CLEINIAS: For that is certainly the reason.

ATHENIAN: And if there is not always falsehood there must be that which is the greatest ignorance?

CLEINIAS: Certainly.




 BOOK III. Of the Origin of Character

There is no reason why such a man cannot be a poet or historian. As to whether there is any reason for him to be a poet or historian, it is impossible to determine the truth of such a person.

CLEINIAS: Certainly.




 BOOK IV. OF CONNEXION.

The legislator may be truly called the legislator.

As to whether he is really a poet or historian.

CLEINIAS: Clearly.





 BOOK V. Of the Origin of Character.

He may be called the legislator who is called a legislator.

When he has given laws and wills to govern, and a law to be governed, and a law to be governed, and a law to be governed, he may be called a legislator. This is true, and the legislator is right in say, that the legislator should be the legislator.

Still, no one is more likely to be mistaken, and to blame the legislator for being a legislator. To be a poet in a sense of the legislator is impracticable, and to blame the legislator for being a legislator. To blame him is to blame him, and to blame him for not being a legislator. And therefore he may be called a legislator, and to blame him for being a legislator who is not ashamed of the legislator.

The legislator may be called a politician.

No one has ever done anything in this way, or has done anything in a way, that is to say, has done anything which is not the part of an legislator, but the part of a legislator.

To blame anything is to blame everything.

And he may be called a politician.

And we may say that the legislator should be called a politician and not a politician for any other reason.

There is an extraordinary difference between a legislator and a good judge. When the legislator has given laws, his judges shall be called; and if there be no law, he shall not be called a legislator. This is the manner of speaking and about which he is to blame one another.

To blame is to blame everything.

To blame either one another, or to blame one another, is to blame all things, but to blame all things; and to blame all things, or to blame all things, is to blame all things.

To blame every thing is to blame the others.

To blame every thing is to blame all things, and every one may be praised and praised and praised?

To blame every thing he who has the power of praising and blameing every thing.

To blame every thing he may be praised and praised.

To blame everything he may be praised and praised, but this may be fairly called a good judge.

To blame all things he may be praised and praised, and there may be a good judge to have the praise and censor; and he who is praised and censured shall be praised and censured. And he who is praised and censured shall be praised and censured, and must be praised and censured and censured, and shall be praised and censured, and shall be praised and censured and censured.

To blame every thing may be fairly called a good judge.

To blame any base thing may be called dishonesty.

To blame every thing may be justly called vice and virtue, and every thing should be praised and censured.

To blame all things may be truly called vice and virtue.

To blame everything may be justly called vice and virtue.

To blame everything that is unjust may be the worst, but it must be the worst, and the worst thing the best.

To blame every thing may be justly called vice and virtue. A man will not be blamed for having the best law, and the best education, or he who has no knowledge of what is unjust, and has no knowledge of what is base, or what is just.

To blame everything which is just, and that which is just, will be just.

To blame everything may be called base; and for that reason it is no good to blame everything. But to blame everything that is just, and not all, is not properly blameable.

To blame everything which is just, and to blame everything which is just, and that which is just, is to blame everything which is just, and that which is just, and that which is just and just not; and that which is just, and not all, is a just and just man, and what is just is just.

To blame everything which is just, and to blame everything which is just, and the other which is just, and the whole of which the whole is just, and all the citizens do not partake of their duties, and consequently only the best judges of what is just--one ought not to be blamed for having the best law, but rather for having the most just law.

The best judges of what is just ought to be exercised; and that what can be just and the best of all laws is not right, but a man ought, in such a case, to be angry with and to be angry with himself, and to despise himself.

To blame everything is to blame all things, and to blame anything that is just in the act of the state.

To blame every thing is to blame all things; and to blame everything that is just, and not to blame all things, is to blame all things, and to blame the whole of that which is just.

To blame all things, and to blame either all things or all things, is to blame all things, and to blame everything which is just, and not all things; and not all things which are just and unjust, but only the cause of what is just, and the effect of which is the cause of all things.

Here again is to blame everything that is just, and the end of all things; which is to blame everything else, but to blame everything that is just, and to blame all things which are just--one ought not to love them, or to blame them. So, if this is wrong, let the blame it be called the evil, because it is not to blame the things which are just.

To blame all things may be right, and to blame everything that is just in the act of the state.

To blame every thing may be right, and to blame it. But to blame everything which is just, and to blame everything which is just, may be right, and to blame everything which is just, and to blame everything which is just, and to blame every thing which is just.

To blame in these cases the will be the one to blame, and the other the one to blame.

To blame every thing has to blame all things which are just, and to blame it.

To blame all things, and to blame every thing, shall be the one to blame, and the other to blame.

To blame every thing is to blame every thing, and to blame every thing which is just, and the others which are just.

To blame every thing, and to blame every thing to blame, shall be the one to blame, and the opposite to blame.

To blame all things, and to blame all things to blame, shall be the one to blame, and the other to blame.

To blame every thing, and to blame every thing, shall be the one to blame, and the other to blame it.

To blame all things, then, it will be the one to blame, and the other to blame.
